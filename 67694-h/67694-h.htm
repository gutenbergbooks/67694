<h3>
PROLOGUE
</h3>

<p>
"Her story," said Ross, aiming his cigar-end at
a phosphorescent patch of ocean, "was
discreditable enough to be true."  He drew an
immense red handkerchief from the pocket of his
pyjamas, and wiped his extensive forehead, muttering,
"As far as a woman ever tells the truth about
herself."
</p>

<p>
I sat on in silence waiting for the epigrams to end
and the narrative to begin.
</p>

<p>
It was a stifling night off the East Coast of Africa.
A wind that blew from the Equator and followed a
crowded ship made sleep impossible.  Nightly it
drove Ross and myself on deck to spend the
intolerable hours in talk.
</p>

<p>
I did not know much about Ross; no one on board
did.  A big man with a walrus moustache and a bald
head, he had joined the vessel at an unusual East
Coast port with few possessions&mdash;a rifle or two, and
a green kit bag.  His preposterous opinions were
enunciated with the precise utterance of a spinster,
and punctuated by pulls at a virulent black cigar.
He knew men and cities; he knew Africa at its heart,
where are neither men nor cities.
</p>

<p>
Our mutual acquaintanceship exhausted, we had
drifted to anecdotes of the improbabilities that
happen daily in that improbable continent.
</p>

<p>
"You can never tell what the most normal folk
will do," he had said.  "One of the most charming
girls I know&mdash;in three weeks she and her husband
had reduced the Decalogue to ribbons...."  He
broke off, and I had difficulty in inducing him to
begin again.
</p>

<p>
"The girl," he said at last, between puffs of his
cigar, "came to me for advice.  This implied no
particular compliment to my wisdom, since I was
the only disinterested white man for a hundred miles.
I told her that only fools gave advice, and only wise
men took it.
</p>

<p>
'God knows I'm not wise,' she said, 'but I'd do
anything to...'
</p>

<p>
'My dear, I'll do my best,' I said when I saw that
she did not mean to finish her sentence, 'but even
for that I must hear a bit more.'  She looked at me
a little startled, then threw up her chin and plunged
into her story.  And, as I said, by most standards,
it did her little enough credit.  Unless courage covers
as much as charity.  Courage is even needed for a
proud woman to tell a man whom she'd met half a
dozen times the full story of her ... 'indiscretions'
shall we call them?"  He paused and seemed to
ponder the qualities and failings of his heroine.
"Still, most of the other animals have courage," he
added.  "And no doubt if she was to stay sane, she
had to get things clear in her own head.  Anyhow,
she spared me no detail or digression in the telling
of her deplorable history."
</p>

<p>
Ross got up and walked heavily to the rail where
he stood staring down at the sea, which parted
before our bows with the sound and motion of split
silk.  His voice came to me a little muted by the
night.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know the Sinclairs well," he continued,
"but by using my eyes at our occasional meetings,
I had a pretty correct idea how matters stood.  And
Archie told me as much as he told any one.  More,
while I was nursing him through three days of
delirium."
</p>

<p>
I ventured to suggest that it would be more interesting
for me if he began the story at the beginning
instead of the end.  He shook his head: "The writer
of the Book of Genesis was the last story teller who
could begin at the beginning.  So much has gone
before.
</p>

<p>
If you want the beginning, you'll have to listen,
for instance, to the history of the house of Cleverly,
from its first earl, the bandit, to its last earl, the
bankrupt, while I trace you Norah's inheritance of
the maxim of that race of rakes ... and occasional
heroes&mdash;'Risk before Repute.'
</p>

<p>
And don't forget we'd have to blend in a survey of
Archie's hard-headed lowland forbears, measure the
immeasurable pride of his Highland mother, estimate
the weight of the legal tradition he inherited from
sire and grandsire, which sees both sides of
everything, and commits itself to nothing, superimpose
Archie's own Oxford training which forbade him
ever to back his fancy&mdash;all that made him that loyal,
hardworking, and in every way estimable stone of
stumbling and rock of offence to poor Norah.
</p>

<p>
And then the scene is set in Africa.  By now the
power of Africa has passed into platitude, but like
most platitude, there's something in it.
</p>

<p>
Every one knows that good fellow, Brown, who
gets through a case of whisky a week on his one-man
station; and that decent chap, Smith, who is
living with a brace of black women somewhere at
the back of beyond; while White's temper has
become so ungovernable that no wonder his wife ran
away from the farm; and, of course, no one believes
that Black's shooting accident was accidental.
</p>

<p>
Many explanations are given.  Medicine, physiology,
geography, psychology, all make their guess.
Superstition too, for if you are living far away in
the great silence of Africa, the silence that is woven
out of a million minute or distant sounds, it is not
difficult to ascribe power over protesting man to
insentient things (if insentient they be); to see the
innumerable trees, the unexplored swamps, the
fantastic rocks as gods or devils, older and crueller than
Jah or Moloch, inexorably shaping the lives of the
foredoomed mortals who have invaded their
sanctuaries."
</p>

<p>
"Plainer men," went on Ross after a pause, "see
there no strange gods, see rather the dangerous
absence of that unromantic Deity, Public Opinion.
In civilised life man's every action is preordained by
the opinion of his fellows.
</p>

<p>
Your young revolutionary may deny this, claiming
that he, at any rate, is a free agent.  But is not
he too bound on the wheel of revolutionary opinion?
Does not the Bolshevik follow the tradition of his
class&mdash;to spit at a bourgeois or whatever it may
be&mdash;as slavishly as a Die-hard peer?
</p>

<p>
In the solitudes, the force is unborn and the
individual is left, now hell is discredited, a law to
himself.
</p>

<p>
So if you ask me to foretell the change that Africa
would work in any given individual, I say, 'Take his
ruling weakness, his Lowest Common Failing: cube
it.  The result will be the man when Africa has done
with him.'"
</p>

<p>
Ross re-lit his atrocious cigar.
</p>

<p>
"By now," he said, "you must regret that you
asked for the beginning of my story.
</p>

<p>
Are you not convinced that it is better to let me
start in the middle of the story and incidentally in
the middle of a lake in the middle of Africa?"
</p>

<p>
"Suppose yourself dead," he continued, taking
my silence for assent, "and seeking variety from
twanging harps round a glassy sea or banging
tambourines in a medium's cabinet, you look down
from the upper air, one day in October, 1921.
Suppose your eye falls on Tanganyika&mdash;that sapphire
coloured cleft which runs eight hundred miles
long by fifty wide through the endless forests of
Central Africa, with the old German Colony to the
right, Belgian Congo to the left, North Eastern
Rhodesia at the near end.
</p>

<p>
Not much humanity for you to patronise: every
thirty miles or so along the edge of the water a
cluster of thatched huts providing a measure of
shelter for a handful of savages who live on fish and
mangoes, careless of the future, indifferent to the
past.  Every 300 miles or so, at a Catholic Mission,
a couple of white-robed Fathers issue rosaries to
their less enlightened neighbours, who until the
missionaries came had to rely on amulets made of
python hearts.  Between these centres of human
endeavour, an uncharted belt of forest fringes the
lake, and climbs the sides of the great cold crater,
until these slope so steep that not even a creeper
can catch hold.  For the last thousand feet the rock
is bare.
</p>

<p>
Forest rings the crater, stretching further than
even you from your advantageous position can see.
Nor can you see through the peacock-blue water to
the bottom of the lake.  They say it hasn't one.
</p>

<p>
On this particular day of your ethereal view, there
is even a bit of human interest in that splendid but
desolate vista.  At the southern end of the lake a
herald of European culture, a broad-beamed steam
tug, lies black and ugly on the fantastically blue
water.  In the bows you may see two figures; from
your remote standpoint, insignificant enough.  You
can discern the features no more than you can read
the passions of the tiny puppets holding each other
close, as if for defence against the indifferent
majesty of nature.
</p>

<p>
From your elevation you can see a third figure.
It is thrusting its way through the forest that borders
the lake at the head of a train of diminutive black
carriers.  Ignorant of each other, the two groups of
marionettes are drawn by wires of Fate, invisible
even to you, into a contact all but fatal to
both."

<h2>
PART I
</h2>

<p class="intro">
"If sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt an erring barbarian
and a supersubtle Venetian be not too hard ... thou shalt enjoy
her."&mdash;W. SHAKESPEARE.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
"Whatever Norah lacked, it was not
looks," said Ross, leaving the rail to fling
himself into a deck-chair that creaked under his
weight.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Beauty and gay clothes, a merry heart<br />
  And a good stomach to a feast are all,<br />
  All the poor crimes you can charge her with,'"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
he murmured.
</p>

<p>
"Not that her heart stayed very merry: while,
for the matter of that, even her beauty was a good
deal altered the last time I met her and heard from
her lips the story I am going to tell you.
</p>

<p>
By then life and Africa had handled her and
treated her as an etcher his plate with steel and acid,
adding something which was not there before, call
it a soul or a complex according to your creed.
</p>

<p>
Well, if from heaven that day you could have
seen her clearly as she sat beside Dick Ward on
the deck of the <i>Mimi</i> you would have remarked,
a bit of a thing, who rode some seven stone, neatly
cut as a Chinese carving, legs and ankles to make
you praise the name of short skirts, short dark hair
that entangled the gleam of shaded lamplight on
mahogany, cheekbones curving out from cheeks,
whose blood (unless that carmine could be claimed
for lip salve) had ebbed to her mouth, on which a
smile mocked more often than it flattered.
</p>

<p>
This smile, her pretty slimness, her moods, mobile
as quicksilver, might have left her what old men call
'a divine imp,' and you could have forgotten her
in the next pretty girl you saw, but for some subtle,
elusive quality&mdash;like a barely perceptible perfume&mdash;that,
troubling and tantalising, forbade oblivion."
</p>

<p>
Ross seemed to meditate.
</p>

<p>
"I doubt," he said at last, "if it be profitable to
anatomise magic; but if I must satisfy your inquiring
turn of mind, I would hazard that it was the
presence of two conflicting strains in Norah that
fascinated the senses.
</p>

<p>
At some time you must have visited the Small
Cat House at the Zoo?  Those drowsy, furry, definite,
little entities.  A trifle sensual, a trifle cruel.
Lazy, individualistic, practical, wicked, fascinating.
Small, pointed faces, red tongues, sharp claws,
sudden motions, quick wits....  Behind the prettiness
and softness something lurks, something of the
night, of the wilds.
</p>

<p>
Well, there was a quality in Norah that
provoked one to the same admiration.  When you
listened to her deep, caressing voice&mdash;as deep a voice
as I've heard in a woman, (some undergraduate once
compared it to the dusk of a summer's day)&mdash;you
were in the presence of something as strange and as
primordial as the dances of the East.
</p>

<p>
Or when you glanced discreetly (should you be a
foreigner, 'when you stared admiringly') at the
elusive line of her face, which fined down to that
evanescent oval, common enough in Italy, so light,
so feminine, or should I say 'so female,' you were
aware of something ... well, there isn't a fair
word.  To describe by opposites it certainly was
not spiritual.  But neither was it animal.  Perhaps
'Southern' is as good an adjective as any.  Not
that she could really trace any meridional blood.
If the Cleverlies went to the Continent for their
mistresses, they stuck to the Shires for their wives.
But unless you are satisfied by a wave of the hand
towards the Small Cat House, 'Southern' is as good
an adjective as I can find you.
</p>

<p>
Then, when you thought you had her classified,
you met the second strain.  Your ears lost her
voice, your gaze left the line of cheek and chin and
travelled to her narrow eyes, dark as night before
sunrise, as a velvet curtain hiding a smouldering
fire; at once you passed to the presence of a
different animal.
</p>

<p>
The Small Cats don't bother their heads about
romance, adventure, rebellion or any generous folly.
I doubt if any occupant of the Zoo does; for that
look you must search the human prisons.
</p>

<p>
But Norah's eyes made you remember forlorn
hopes, lost causes, desperate adventures, despairing
loyalties; all that uncomfortable side of life which
the prudent man avoids.  And when they gazed at
you under their arched, delicate brows, you felt
admiration or pity according to your lights, for a
fellow mortal, spurred by impractical generosities,
dazzled by romantic imaginings, ridden by rebellious
longings, who'd funk no fence that Life might
offer&mdash;Life isn't only fences," broke off Ross to mutter.
"It's the plough that kills the likes of her."
</p>

<p>
"Dick Ward," he went on, "was gazing, no doubt,
into those romantic orbs at the minute my story
begins, and reading a flattering message in their
courageous depths.
</p>

<p>
One could not look at Dick without pleasure.
He presented a Lucifer-son-of-the-morning effect.
</p>

<p>
The 'Greek god' type, which fluttered our grandmothers,
lacks sufficient kick for the Neo-georgian
maid.  His hair was perhaps a shade too long for
male taste, though women seem in this to be more
lenient.  That people, on first acquaintance, were
apt to take him for an American was possibly due
to his faint Irish intonation, and he was so
wonderfully sure, so well poised, and so preposterously
good looking.
</p>

<p>
During the war he served in the Air Force.
When peace returned, a rich uncle's death saved
him from the horrors of work.  Wealth was added
to charm, wit, good looks&mdash;unless vows matter, can
you blame Norah so much?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Marriage laws are drafted by the old,' he had
just said, to calm some scruple, 'to be broken by
the young.'
</p>

<p>
'Dick, don't be so Wilde!' she retorted.  This
isn't the setting.  Look at the Lake....'
</p>

<p>
'I'd rather look at the woman!'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be an ass.  The woman's there any day,
Tanganyika&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I can't believe yet she will be.  I'm afraid of
waking up.'
</p>

<p>
'I feel I've dreamt away my life till now: I've
only just woken up.  Woken up from a bad dream
about Africa.'
</p>

<p>
'Africa is nearly over.  Two days up the Lake
to the railway, then&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Do you so badly want the time to hurry?'
</p>

<p>
'Every second with you is worth a life, only&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Only you'd sooner catch the train.'
</p>

<p>
'Aren't you ever serious, Norah?  You know
I love you with&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I often wonder if you love me at all, Dick.'
</p>

<p>
'No one has ever loved a woman so.'
</p>

<p>
'Supposing, of course, there is such a thing as
love.'
</p>

<p>
'Norah!'
</p>

<p>
'Love that survives appetite.'
</p>

<p>
'Darling!'.
</p>

<p>
'Well, you see, I loved before.'
</p>

<p>
'As much as ... now?'
</p>

<p>
'Differently, perhaps.'
</p>

<p>
'And my love is different.  My love....'
</p>

<p>
But we'll leave Dick's amatory eloquence to the
sufficient audience of Norah and the extinct volcanoes
that ring the Lake.  In their youth, they, too,
had known outbursts of fire and passionate
contortion: now cold and desolate, with puffs of cloud
nestling like patches of snow in their hollow flanks,
bluer than any precious stone, they stared down in
unmoved silence.
</p>

<p>
All day the <i>Mimi</i> steamed slowly and fussily,
the sun beating fiercely on her crowded deck through
the thin awning.  Norah lay full length on the camp
bed her body servant had put up.  The <i>Mimi</i> did
not run to cabins&mdash;you shared her deck with her
doubtfully Arab captain, who lounged in a
three-legged wicker chair.  Other competitors for the
narrow space were the negro crew with their household
gods, the couple of lean goats, and the dozen
lousy fowls that formed the vessel's food supply.
</p>

<p>
A portion aft was reserved for native passengers,
a class represented this trip by one incredibly lean
Indian, with a wiry beard and a blue and white
check turban.  He sat on a hatch, naked to the waist,
his thin legs crossed, motionless for hours.  Each
time that Norah glanced in his direction his brows
seemed to bend in a scowl at the two Europeans.
</p>

<p>
So all that day they steamed over the Lake, whose
sapphire waters were cool to the eye and tepid to
the hand.  Towards evening they anchored off a
fishing village where the captain had told them an
Arab was waiting with oxen to ship to a mission
up the Lake.  He had driven them from a village,
a hundred miles to the south, where his father had
settled in the days of the slave trade.
</p>

<p>
Norah was roused from drowsy contemplation of
Dick's profile by a shout; she felt the engines go half
speed and idly she watched a ragged silhouette
sounding over the bows with a painted rod.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Bili</i> ... <i>bili</i>&mdash;two fathoms ... two fathoms.'  Another
shout, and the engines were silent.  She
rose and took Dick's arm as he leaned over the
bulwarks gazing landwards.
</p>

<p>
'What is it?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'I was planning.'
</p>

<p>
'About us?'
</p>

<p>
When we're home.  What we'll do; where'll
we go; what we'll see.'
</p>

<p>
'Never anything stranger than this,' she nodded
towards the shore.
</p>

<p>
Sheer red cliffs loomed above them.  Like
futurist painting, violent colours lay in slabs.  A
streak of faint green sky topped the sandstone wall
off which blazed the refulgence of the declining sun;
a strip of beach slid a tongue of silver between that
fiery barrier and the deepening blue of the Lake.
</p>

<p>
'Pity you can't paint, Dick.  Call it "Drink of
Water in Hell," or something bright.'
</p>

<p>
'The village spoils it.  Victorian almost.'
</p>

<p>
The village, which contrasted the pacificism of
man with the violence of nature, stretched its single
row of oblong huts under the compact shade of
gray-green mango-trees.  Their shadow fell black on
the ragged thatch which fined from the chocolate
colour of the peak, discoloured by innumerable
cooking fires, to silver at the eaves.
</p>

<p>
Groups of placid or indifferent men squatted on
the verandahs without motion save for the occasional
act of taking snuff.  The only sound came from a
woman who knelt and pounded millet.  The smooth
wooden block raised with her two hands beat
rhythmically in the worn mortar.
</p>

<p>
A group of naked babies splashed among wavelets
too tiny to disturb even their slight equilibrium.
</p>

<p>
And Norah's heart warmed to the quiet humanity
of the scene.  A thought struck her: 'What about
those babies and crocs?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' said Dick.  'There aren't crocs everywhere.
It's uninhabited bays they like.'
</p>

<p>
The advent of the steamer created no stir.  At
last a family, more enterprising or more avaricious
than the rest, was moved to abandon the quietude
of their verandah for the yellow sunlight of the
beach, where their naked forms were silhouetted,
straining at the launch of one of the dozen grey
dugouts that pointed in every direction on the sand.
The example set, the <i>Mimi</i> was soon ringed by slim
canoes laden with long bunches of bananas, purplish
green mangoes, and fish of the lake.
</p>

<p>
'Better buy some, Dick, we haven't too much
food with us,' counselled Norah.  'And we mayn't
have another chance before Kigoma.'
</p>

<p>
'What about half a dozen of those?' he pointed
to an odd looking yellow barbel with grotesque
whiskers.  It was as big as a child of ten.
</p>

<p>
Norah shuddered.
</p>

<p>
'What's that?' she asked in Swahili, pointing to
another fish.  'Is it good eating?'
</p>

<p>
'<i>Coupi</i>, memsahib,' said the villager, holding up
a sort of carp that looked as if it had been
inexpertly dyed a poisonous saffron.
</p>

<p>
'See the blue marking on its belly!' said Dick.
'What a colour!'
</p>

<p>
'Lapis-lazuli, isn't it?'"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
For some time Ross had seemed to try my
credulity high.
</p>

<p>
"Do you mean to tell me," I cried, "that Lady
Norah repeated to you the words of the most trivial
conversations, minute details that caught her eye,
vague impressions that darted across her brain?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course not," said Ross calmly, "but she told
me enough to let me fill them in with certainty.
You surely don't demand the 'or words to that effect'
of the metropolitan police at each moment.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"The cattle dealer," he continued placidly, "who,
for many days had been awaiting the boat's arrival,
had driven two oxen knee-deep into the water.  A
couple of deck-hands tumbled, laughing and talking,
into the ship's dinghy and paddled towards them.
</p>

<p>
Norah, whose attention was as easily caught by
life's activities as any errand boy's, left the
bargaining crowd to watch the boat's return.
</p>

<p>
Horns, muzzles, humps alone visible out of the
water, the beasts swam tied to either rowlock.
Supporting the head of one, its owner hung over the
gunwale.  The other less favoured ox submerged
each time the slight swell struck him and, as he
rose again above the surface, snorted stentorianly.
</p>

<p>
A cable, paid out from the ship, at a second
attempt was noosed over one pair of wide horns.
The firemen bent to the capstan, answering the
long-drawn chant of their capitao 'oo-ère' with a staccato
'wére.'  Slowly the derrick lifted the heavy beast by
his horns into the air where he hung grotesquely,
pawing and patient.  A signal was given and the
beam swung inboard, the ox slipping a little as his
hoofs met the unfamiliar plates of the deck.
</p>

<p>
The second beast was more truculent.  No sooner
had he touched deck and felt his horns free of the
noose than, lunging forward, he tossed one of the
ship's goats into the hold.  The crew laughed
delightedly.  The ox stood, his feelings outraged,
scraping the deck with his hoof and swaying his
lowered head.
</p>

<p>
'Look out, Dick,' cried Norah, wise in the ways
of cattle.  'He's coming for you.'
</p>

<p>
But Dick would not have been quick enough to
escape the fate of the goat, had not Norah presented
a stick to the oncoming muzzle.  Faced with the
alternative of bumping his nose, or abandoning his
objective, scared and nervy, rather than ugly-tempered,
he shambled off, lowing, to the after end
of the ship.
</p>

<p>
'Brute,' said Dick, but Norah followed and had
her late opponent slobbering his wet muzzle into her
sleeve.
</p>

<p>
His owner, the Arab, in a hurry to start his
hundred-mile walk home, had rowed back to shore
to collect his herd boys, who lay on the beach, at
the edge of the lapping water.  His white-robed
figure was visible for a moment on the path leading
into the hills behind the village, before it disappeared
among the trees.  The voices of his ragged followers
were audible a little longer, then silence fell as the
village settled for the night.  Blue smoke rose
through every roof and hovered in a mist over the
village; the smell of wood fires and cooking was
added to the faintly saline breath of the Lake.
Presently the moon came up and touched with silver
the crest of every ripple.  Across the glittering
pathway slid the silhouette of a canoe and, lying in her
bows, an adolescent began to twang a native guitar."

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Telling the story a fortnight later, Norah
said that this evening offered her the last
peace and contentment she was to know.  I fancy
one must have youth as well as a good digestion on
one's side to feel peaceful and content a few weeks
after deserting a devoted husband.  But scruples, if
women ever have them, lapse in love, and more fully
I imagine when the game is played with so splendid
a partner in so romantic a scene.
</p>

<p>
All her life, Norah had taken to romance, as
other folk take to drink, or politics.  The cure, you
shall see, was drastic.
</p>

<p>
As a child, she had run wild.  Her mother had
died at her birth, and her father was interminably
engaged in a series of unsuccessful operations on the
markets, the turf, or the tables.  A succession of
governesses threw in their hands after a brief
attempt, unbacked by any parental authority, to
control her.  From them, however, she learned to
read and write, and from the coachman, to swear.
Otherwise, she had little regular education.
</p>

<p>
She made up for it in the great dilapidated library
where she browsed, uncontrolled, among the great
debris of the past.  Poetry, drama, novels, history,
it did not matter, so long as it had a story and a
swing.  Not a very high criterion, perhaps, but it
led her to Shakespeare, and the <i>Arabian Nights</i>,
Marlowe and Webster, Froissart and Hakluyt,
Chaucer, Drayton, Otway, Defoe, Byron.  There
seemed to be a wonderful world waiting for her,
wonderful lands to visit, wonderful deeds to dare,
wonderful men to meet.
</p>

<p>
The outbreak of war swung her from this world
of books into life and a phase of life then strange
enough to any of us.
</p>

<p>
She was seventeen when she started work as a
V.A.D. and eighteen when she received her eventual
discharge with the infraction of every rule to her
discredit.  In her first round with discipline that
unimaginative force had won.  She spent a night of
tears and abasement, feeling that to have her way,
she had failed her country and her class.
</p>

<p>
But the votaries of Romance are not easily, if
indeed they are ever, discouraged.  The next morning
she joined a volunteer Red Cross column, which
a wealthy humanitarian was raising for service with
the Russian Armies.
</p>

<p>
In those days we still believed, if not in the great
steam roller, at least in the great soul of Russia.
Our stale, materialistic civilisation was to be
quickened with an air blowing cold from the steppes.
The way had been shown us, our enthusiasts
instanced, by the Muscovite abnegation of vodka;
forgetting that a Russian is only worth listening to
when he is drunk.  Regeneration was dawning,
convincingly enough, in the east; they little knew how
red that dawn.
</p>

<p>
Norah eagerly seized the chance of reinstating
herself in her own esteem.  And no doubt the
glamour of the country of the Tsars called her.
During her months with the V.A.D. her stout heart,
quick wits, and clever fingers had picked up
something of war-time nursing.  It is not difficult to
believe that her beauty, if not her skill, was welcome
to the overworked, ill-equipped French and Russian
doctors, who laboured day and night behind the
Russian front at the first dressing station where
worked the column."
</p>

<p>
Ross hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"She told me," he said, "a good many interesting
things about this experience of hers&mdash;of operations
by candle-light on the kitchen tables of abandoned
farms, of a long-haired pope attached to the column
whom horror drove mad one night in a shattered
tavern; but the story will be long enough without
any picturesque extras, and we'll go straight on to
the day that the Sisters, for a joke, I suppose, crossed
Norah's thread with Archie's.
</p>

<p>
Archie Sinclair was not, of course, in the least
like Dick Ward.
</p>

<p>
In his adventures, the male unconsciously pursues
one chosen type, finding in his mates, if only for a
moment, an approximation to his dreams.  Just as,
in a palpable desert, it is the mirage of water that
men follow, ignoring other less desired deception.
</p>

<p>
Deception it is.  Alone the hermits of the Thebaid
attained to the achievement of temptation without
realisation.  Less fortunate men find in possession
the denial of the dream.
</p>

<p>
Women never follow this ideal of monotony.
Their husbands, their lovers, are the glasses through
which they survey the world.  Sometimes one wants
spectacles, sometimes lorgnettes, sometimes
field-glasses.
</p>

<p>
Dick was successful, splendid, heroically moulded.
He took the eye and filled the stage.  Archie was
small and unremarkable.  He hated emotion,
gestures in any degree.  Expression made him
uncomfortable; and any display of generous sentiment,
noble aspiration or lofty ideal he met with
embarrassed silence.  But he lacked the self-confidence
that would have qualified him for the slightly
unfashionable ranks of Strong Silent Men.  Meeting
him casually, he struck you as irresolute.  'Cautious'
was really a truer diagnosis.
</p>

<p>
Like Dick, he was a Celt.  But while Dick was
the type that fills parliaments and places where they
talk, Archie was the dark, inconspicuous sort that is
only dragged from its holes in the hills into public
by outside force.
</p>

<p>
His father and grandfather had practised at the
Scottish Bar; he was himself destined for the same
career, but circumstances, in the obscure shape of a
handful of Serbian assassins, landed him in a
gun-pit in a picturesque valley at the foot of the
Carpathian Mountains.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As an earnest young Liberal at the Union Debating
Society, Oxford, Archie had repeatedly proved
the impossibility of war under modern conditions.
In August, 1914, however, when Europe had failed
to realise this impossibility, Archie, after two days
of more than usual reticence, announced that he was
off next day to Glasgow.  Pressed to give his
motives, he muttered that he supposed it was up to one
to join.  As he didn't think he'd make much of an
officer, he'd enlisted.
</p>

<p>
Before very long Gunner Sinclair was drafted out
to Flanders to replace casualties.  He spent an evil
winter in the mud of the Salient where endurance
found more scope than dash.  When Spring came
to the desolate scene, he was sent home to receive a
commission and to train with a Kitchener division.
</p>

<p>
At that time things were going badly in Russia.
Sukomlinov, the war minister, was suspected not
merely of the incompetence that is demanded of
a war minister, or of the corruption which is expected
of any Russian official, but of an active intelligence
with the enemy, not tolerable in the early stages
of a war.
</p>

<p>
It was found impossible to supply rifles and small
arms ammunition, let alone artillery and shells, to
the hitherto victorious army of the Grand Duke in
the Carpathians; and it became necessary for the
infantry&mdash;rude, unpolished fellows for the most
part&mdash;to troop over the top without rifles or artillery
support, against a well-equipped and entrenched
enemy.
</p>

<p>
To limit the retreat which unexpectedly became
necessary, the Russian Government applied to
England for guns and munitions.
</p>

<p>
The War Office and the politicians, realising the
seriousness of the position, and standing on the
well-proved maxim that, 'if a thing is worth doing at
all, it is worth doing half,' fitted out several batteries
of more or less obsolete twelve pounders&mdash;old Horse
Artillery ware&mdash;and embarked them to the aid of
their allies.  Second Lieutenant Sinclair was a
section commander in one of these units.
</p>

<p>
Archie, never communicative, told me little of his
share in that disastrous campaign&mdash;disastrous, but
not inglorious, if death and sacrifice can dignify.
But for my story's sake, from the bald and insufficient
facts he let fall, I must try to outline the last
evening's fighting, that contrived the confluence of
his and Norah's lives.
</p>

<p>
The scene, he said, was a gun-pit at the side of a
muddy road, which led through a ransacked Galician
village.  Its wretched hovels had been gutted by the
retiring troops, and from a window of the only
two-storied house, the black-robed body of a Jew swung
by the neck.  A playful habit of the retreating
Muscovite, designed to discourage espionage.  By
now the shadow of the mountain, under whose flank
the village lay, mercifully obscured his features.
</p>

<p>
On the road that passed the gun-pit, bodies of
men and horses lay like burst sacks to show where
a direct hit had exploded the ammunition limber of
Archie's second gun as the team was hooking in.
</p>

<p>
His section had been left to cover the brigade's
withdrawal to a fresh position down the valley.
When their unmolested retreat had been secured,
his first gun, successfully extricated, had followed
on down the hill.
</p>

<p>
The Austrian fire was ill-aimed, and spasmodic.
The crash and dust of falling masonry at the far
end of the straggling village, or spouts of black earth
from the fields beyond, showed where the shells were
falling.  But the God of Battles decided that the
moment selected by Archie to limber up his second
gun should be chosen by the number 4 of an Austrian
120 mm. somewhere up the valley to insert a defective
round.  The shell dropped a quarter of a mile
short of its fellows to score the direct hit on the
limber.
</p>

<p>
When the smoke of the explosion had cleared,
only Archie, his sergeant, one driver and one horse
of the team were able to pick themselves up from the
ground.
</p>

<p>
Archie's brain worked quicker than its wont.
There were not many alternatives.
</p>

<p>
'Driver Evans,' he said, 'are you all right to ride?'
</p>

<p>
'Yessir!'
</p>

<p>
'Have a look at Dossie, and see if she will carry
you.'
</p>

<p>
With his hand pressed to his side, where a piece
of flying metal had caught him, he examined the
damage done to the gun.  The sergeant was at work
with Archie's revolver among the wounded horses.
</p>

<p>
The driver reported that, bar a bit of skin gone,
the off-leader would do.
</p>

<p>
'Good,' said Archie.  'Then mount and follow the
battery hell for blast.  If they have gone to their
new positions, find them.  Tell the major what has
happened.  Say the gun is worth saving, if he can
get a team up in the night.  There are no Austrians
in sight; if they are not here before dark, they will
probably wait till dawn.  Tell him none of us can
walk except Sergeant Yates and myself.  Understand?'
</p>

<p>
Evans saluted, and swung round on his heel.
Archie and the sergeant busied themselves with
first-aid dressings and fetching water for the wounded.
Whenever the stoicism of his kind let a sufferer ask
what was happening:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Driver Evans is finding the Major,' said Archie.
'When it's dark, he'll send up to pull the gun and
us out.'
</p>

<p>
It was not, he knew, as simple as that.  The
battery had a long start, and would by now be
concealed in a new position.  In a strange country and
with a foreign tongue, the driver would be very
lucky if he found it.  But there seemed no better
plan.
</p>

<p>
To look for civilian transport in the scarred desert
that the retreating army left in its wake was to
waste time.  Time that was all too short, even if the
Austrian advance guard, accustomed to the almost
defenceless condition of the Russian rear at that
date, and misled by the English expenditure of
ammunition, advanced with unjustified caution.
</p>

<p>
The hours passed.  Archie watched the shadow of
the western hills, as it spread across the valley, and
still no attack came.
</p>

<p>
I tactlessly asked him what he felt like as he
waited.
</p>

<p>
He stared at me.
</p>

<p>
'Felt like?' he repeated.  'I didn't register
feelings.  I was talking to the men.'
</p>

<p>
'What did you talk about?'
</p>

<p>
'I forget.  Football, I think.  And boxing.  One
of the men had been Army Welter Champion in
India.  Poor devil.  I don't suppose he boxed again.'
</p>

<p>
All the same, I can't help thinking that in such a
situation the alternatives of sudden death, prison or
salvation must have danced their round in the brain
of even the least imaginative of men.
</p>

<p>
At last darkness fell, and the enemy's fire ceased.
Archie stood up and strained his ears for any sound
that might betray an advance, but all he heard was
the painful breathing of his wounded men, or a
groan from the layer, who was hit in the stomach,
and unlikely to live the night.
</p>

<p>
'Sergeant,' whispered Archie, 'time you were off.'
</p>

<p>
'Beg pardon, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'One of us is enough to stay with these chaps till
help comes.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't mean me to go, sir?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, sergeant!  Get back to the battery.  Besides,
you can hurry them up.'
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly, Sergeant Yates disappeared and
Archie was left in the dark with his disabled gun
and his dead and dying men.  His side hurt him,
and his heart ached for his companions.  He calculated
and re-calculated how soon help could come,
till, as the long hours passed, doubt became certainty
that his message had miscarried.
</p>

<p>
He could hardly guess that his destiny had been
crossed by the fortunes of Private Pyotr Pavlovitch
of the Seventh Siberian Rifles.  Pyotr had been
holding remarkable hands at 'vint' that morning in
the trenches before he and his battalion had been
withdrawn under the cover of the British guns.  He
had won a shirt from Ivan Ilyitch, and ten
(pre-revolution) roubles from Dmitri Kalkanov.  Can it
be wondered that having traversed the cheaper stages
of loquacity and truculence, he now lay in deep
slumber across the road?
</p>

<p>
Observe, moreover, the careful dispositions of
Providence.  Had he held a trump less, and won
a kopeck fewer, he would have fallen a moment
sooner into the ditch at the side of the road.  In
that case his prostrate body would not have brought,
poor, tired, off-leader Dossie down in a heap, nor
sent Driver Evans with a broken leg and concussion
to Norah's first dressing station.  Neither would the
board have been set for the game which was to be
played five years later on Lake Tanganyika.
</p>

<p>
Norah's hand was on her compatriot's head when
his eyes opened, and her ear close to his lips that
demanded feebly to continue his search for the
battery.  She shook her head and pointed to his leg.
Driver Evans persisted and explained his persistence.
</p>

<p>
She invoked the aid of the chief doctor of the
column, a celebrated French surgeon.
</p>

<p>
'I will do all I can for your compatriots, Lady
Norah,' he said, 'but I'm afraid it isn't much.'
</p>

<p>
Norah's foot tapped the floor while he scribbled
a note and gave it to his orderly.
</p>

<p>
'Nobody here would know where the battery is;
Peter will carry this note to the brigadier.
However...' he shrugged his shoulders and turned to
the case he was dressing.
</p>

<p>
Norah heard him murmur to his assistant: 'A
cette heure-ci le Russe sera certainement couché avec
une poule quelconque.  Pas moyen de l'y déranger
pour une telle bagatelle que les vies de ses soldats.'
</p>

<p>
Norah bit her lip and went back to Driver Evans.
How masculine it all was!  Discipline and routine
and inefficiency.  While the surgeon shrugged his
shoulders and the General slept with his woman, her
men were dying.
</p>

<p>
She made up her mind, and, bending over Evans,
plied him with as many questions as he could answer.
Then, with her comic little air of decision, she
crammed a round grey astrachan hat on her head,
swung a black Caucasian cloak of pony skin on to
her shoulders and made for the stables.
</p>

<p>
The sleepy transport sergeant was dragged out
of his bed and set to start the Ford box-car, which
carried the personal baggage of the column.  Grumbling,
but obedient to her English air of certainty,
he swung the engine into life."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I've spent too long on this episode introducing
to your notice Norah Cleverly, and Archie Sinclair,"
said Ross with a yawn, "to allow me to describe to
you her ride.  On horseback, it would have claimed
a poet's pen.  As the mount was a Ford car, I can
only say the road was abominable, scored into deep
ruts, strewn with boulders, and, without lights,
invisible.  How the car kept together and the girl's
strength held out and how they escaped total wreck,
I can't imagine.  A stoutish bit of work.  Eventually&mdash;about
the time that Archie's layer died in his
arms&mdash;the Ford came to a full stop in the sand with its
wheels spinning round tyre-deep.
</p>

<p>
Norah jumped out and pushed.  The car did not
stir.  She looked for stones to put under the wheels
to give them grip.  She saw nothing but sand and
immovable boulders.  She sat on the step, the tears
hot in her eyes.  Not from fear at her position in the
route of the victorious Austrian army, but from
anger at her failure, and from pity for the men she
had failed to rescue.
</p>

<p>
After a time she heard a voice raised in song.
Russians, she knew, sing about the Volga, Teutons
about the 'Heimat.'  When, therefore, she heard the
words:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'And when I die, don't bury me at all,<br />
  Just pickle my bones in al-co-hol...'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she recognised a compatriot.
</p>

<p>
'God bless my soul,' said Sergeant Yates, a minute later.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
'Listen,' said Archie to the survivors of his party,
a little before dawn, 'isn't that a Ford?'
</p>

<p>
'Then they 'ave them in 'ell too,' groaned a
cockney driver, who was sure he would die of his
wounds before the morning.  The rattle ceased
behind the shattered cottages.  A pause interminable
to Archie ensued.  He stood fingering his revolver.
Had the Austrians got round behind them?  Were
they preparing the rush which would end all?  Two
figures visible against the crumbling white walls
detached themselves from the dark.  He wondered
whether to challenge them or trust to the cover of
darkness.  They loomed closer, picking their way
slowly over the battle-torn ground.  Archie waited
till they were at arm's length, before he pressed the
button of his torch.
</p>

<p>
The white circle of light framed a young girl's
face: yellow mud was smeared on her cheek, and
she shook a tumble of curls out of her eyes."

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
At first she can hardly have seemed credible to
Archie, momentarily expecting the end.  In
the middle of death and destruction, suddenly this
vivid beauty.  And not an academic, ideal beauty
demanding worship of brain or senses, but a practical
travel-stained young woman holding rescue in her
hands.  His feelings can't have been very clear.
When hope of life suddenly dawns, men don't
bother much with the outlying emotions.  Moreover,
Archie was busy getting his wounded men, as gently
as the ground would allow, into the box-car.  But
he must have been conscious of a great wonder,
wonder at this eleventh hour salvation, wonder at
her beauty and courage.
</p>

<p>
It was not till afterwards, in his bunk at the
dressing station, when his broken ribs had been
strapped, that he settled into the steady devotion
which was to be his guide and his torment in days
to come.  From the start he was a humble lover,
asking little, diffident of his fortune.  Whether the
fortune was good or ill, no outsider can say: but
on that night of battle, at first sight, Archie was
loved by Norah.  It was the old story of Ares and
Aphrodite entangled in the net, but a net spread by
artificers, more cunning even than Hephæstus&mdash;Romance
and Pity.
</p>

<p>
Archie, seeing the fight out, and standing by his
men wounded and dead, his clothes torn by the
explosion, his face discoloured with dust, smoke and
blood, his eyes ravaged with sleeplessness and pain,
seemed to Norah a figure heroically proportioned in
its tenacity, devotion and isolation.  And while her
spirit paid tribute to the hero, her heart ached to
mother the poor, tired boy.
</p>

<p>
Archie's broken rib and some hitch in clearing the
wounded from the dressing station to the base, gave
scope to this aspiration and the sick-bed completed
what the battlefield had begun.  To such purpose,
that, as soon as Archie's bones and Norah's duties
allowed, they were married.
</p>

<p>
Every marriage is said to be pre-ordained by the
female, and baited for the male with the illusion of
choice.  Whether this is always true, I have no doubt
that here Norah took the lead.  Of course Archie
would have sold his soul for her, but where would
he find the decision to tell her so?  She must have
helped him out, her love translating his silences into
mute eloquence, his caution into noble modesty, his
reticence into silent strength.  She was young enough
to demand perfection in the object of her affections,
and deep enough in love to find it.  Obstacles and
conventions only acted as spurs to her hot blood.
Her natural bent was to put all her money on one
horse and that for a win, never a place.  In this the
war lent her reason, urging her to pluck the day ere
night fell, to take and give what life offered before
death laid his claim.  It needs, I think, an old head
and a cold heart to condemn these war marriages.
</p>

<p>
Archie, whose Scottish nature appreciated the
unfavourable side of everything, no doubt saw each
of the hundred reasons against the marriage.  He
may have realised their difference of temper,
foreseen the parental disapproval of the solid Scots
lawyer and the impecunious English peer, calculated
money difficulties, guessed that Norah was in love
with an aspect of him, which peace time&mdash;should he
survive the war&mdash;would never call into being.
</p>

<p>
But can any man, even a Scot, let this weigh when
he is fast in love with an incredible apparition, who
has saved his life and lets him see that his love is not
unacceptable?  To my mind, Archie deserves neither
blame nor pity&mdash;beauty and guts mayn't be a pass
into the Kingdom of Heaven, but they carry a girl
a long way towards Holy Matrimony.
</p>

<p>
Judge it as you may, the marriage took place not
many weeks after their meeting in that Carpathian
valley, as soon in fact as Norah had got home and
Archie had been released from his London hospital.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the quietness of the wedding, our
modern Argus got hold of the story and billed them
as 'Red Cross Romance: Peer's Daughter Rescues
Artillery Lieutenant.'
</p>

<p>
The Peer let it be felt that he regretted the
rescue; while the father of the lieutenant indicated
that if he went his own way, he must pay it.
</p>

<p>
This lack of enthusiasm emphasised the romantic
nature of the union, and the happiness of the young
couple was only interrupted by the end of Archie's
sick leave, and his return to Flanders.
</p>

<p>
From then life began to thrust them apart, as
surely as a tree-root forces asunder two stones in a
wall.  Not that these two stones can ever have been
very truly laid.  Archie's reserved devotion can
never have satisfied Norah's capacity for passion.
She asked for the wine of life and got its breakfast
food.  But while that Carpathian picture was not
effaced, she would see no flaws in her hero.  Nor,
during his long absences at the front, and his short
visits on leave, did she perceive the difference
between the man and the picture.  She longed
passionately for his return and loved him dearly when
he came.  But apart from his brief periods of leave,
the first hours of which were always wasted in a sort
of strangerhood, they had no life in common to
buttress up Romance and to let picture tone into
fact.
</p>

<p>
Norah did not lack humour, and had war allowed,
daily companionship would have built up affection
for the man to supplement and in time supplant
adoration of the hero.  The daily letters which passed
between the flat in Baker Street and the dug-out in
Flanders&mdash;Archie's rather formal chronicles and
Norah's passionate little notes&mdash;could not take the
place of the personal intercourse which war denied
them.
</p>

<p>
I know it is the thought of meeting the object of
their passion daily at breakfast that heads off many
a Benedict and Beatrice.  But it is only by
submitting to the humanising influence of small daily
contacts that love will provide a working basis for
marriage.  Without this humanising, love does not
develop but starves."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know you were married, Ross," I
interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not," he replied, and went on with his story.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Norah's environment did not help her to keep
in touch with her husband.  In his absence she was
absorbed into the circle of her family, by none of
whom was Archie known or appreciated.  A different
atmosphere was created in which Archie drew no
breath.  New points of view and standards of life
presented themselves to her young eyes.  This was
her first taste of London, and a strange world lay at
her feet.  No wonder her head was a little dizzied.
She drove an ambulance by day, and by night she
danced.  Her beauty, vivacity and birth made her
acceptable to that set which won the war by going
to charity matinées.  She did not like it, but found
its glitter stimulating.  At the houses of her relations
she met celebrated, handsome, and amusing men.
And, in truth, though the comparison never presented
itself, they were a good deal better company
than poor, silent Archie.
</p>

<p>
After three years of this the war ended, and
Archie came home.  He was far too devoted to
Norah to ask her to alter her way of life, and while
his gratuity lasted, he took her to dinners, theatres,
races, dances, night clubs; all that hostesses,
restaurateurs and impresarios pass off on us for
'pleasure.'
</p>

<p>
I don't suppose Archie showed at his best in these
surroundings.  He had scant small talk, and
probably an indifferent tailor.
</p>

<p>
During these weeks, disillusionment first reared its
head.  For both their sakes I hope the process was
gradual, but I think passion would desert Norah's
quick heart as capriciously as it visited it.
</p>

<p>
Archie must have looked forward to the time
when his gratuity would be exhausted and the
two-pences for the merry-go-round would no longer be
forthcoming.  Then they would have to retire to
Edinburgh and live on their small income, while
Archie made his way at the Scottish Bar, like his
fathers before him.  Unfortunately, his nature was
to keep his views to himself.  He did not disclose
them until one evening at supper at Giro's.  The
disclosure was disastrous.
</p>

<p>
They had dined, a trifle noisily, at the mansion
of a South African Jew, whose acquaintance Norah
had made during the war when only aliens could
procure luxuries.  I had known their host before he
became respectable&mdash;too well, indeed, to be
dropped&mdash;and had also been invited.
</p>

<p>
The war had left me lame, and Norah, in whom
modish hardness hid a compassionate heart, insisted
on picking me up in her taxi.  She was looking, I
thought, very adorable.  Her frock was made of
some sort of shot silk, very bright.  It fitted her
straight little figure closely down to her waist,
spreading out below in scalloped flounces.  The
suggestion was a fin-de-siècle shepherdess, strayed from
Arcady to Park Lane.
</p>

<p>
Over her shoulders hung a cloak lined with green
brocade.  Its upright collar of monkey fur framed
with spikes the piquancy of her face.  Her high
cheekbones were rouged, her wide mouth drooped a
little at the corners.
</p>

<p>
Archie made a good background.  He was slight
and dark.  Typically, he wore a dinner jacket
instead of the tail-coat that the rest of the party
would sport.  His hair was close-cropped and grew
high on his forehead.  His face was clean shaven
and rather weather-beaten, with a well formed nose
and an obstinate chin.  His supra-orbital sinus, as
the anatomists call the bar of the eyebrows, was
pronounced and his grey eyes seemed sunken
beneath it.  He looked uncommonly wiry, giving an
impression of 'no waste'&mdash;no spare flesh, no spare
words, no spare emotions.  Condemning emotion he
substituted Reason, thereby coming more of a
mucker than the ordinary irrational man.  His
anxiety to be reasonable gave him an irresolute air.
He was still balancing questions which years before
ordinary men had settled by instinct, prejudice or
indifference.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
After dinner we went to the last act of the last
revue, though why the discomfort of a box should
be sought for conversation that could perfectly well
be held at home, I never know.  When the theatre
was over, and the party had broken up, I heard
Norah tell Archie she was too tired to go home and
wanted supper.
</p>

<p>
Apparently the supper was not a success.  Archie
ordered champagne.  Norah tasted it, and made a
face.
</p>

<p>
'My dear,' she said, 'the stuff's undrinkable.  Do
order something a little less like what they give you
in church!'
</p>

<p>
Archie, in whose opinion wine began and ended
with port, said nothing, and beckoned the wine
waiter.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, he betrayed his thoughts by a
slight shrug.  Norah, who was tired and nervy, saw
it.
</p>

<p>
'All right, I won't have it then.  I suppose you
think we can't afford it.'  Archie shook his head.
Much of his conversation was by sign.  When you
asked him a question, he paused before answering.
A stranger would think he had not heard, and would
repeat his question; but Archie was only thinking
over his reply&mdash;a habit which may make valuable
contribution to thought, but does not help small
talk.  Sometimes it would be your penultimate
remark which he answered, having duly considered
the question during the intermediate talk.  No,
Archie was not a conversationalist.  But now Norah
felt the need of opening her heart.
</p>

<p>
'I wish <i>you'd</i> drink a bit more fizz, Archie.  It
might binge you up a bit.  You sat all through
dinner looking as bored as sin, and you didn't smile
once at the play or even at Tony Moorhouse.'
</p>

<p>
That gilded youth, after a conscientious patronage
of the magnate's cellar, had subjected the revue
artistes to a flow of not very witty interruption.  The
party had shrieked with laughter, and Archie had
flattered himself that he, too, had gone through the
motions of being amused.
</p>

<p>
'I'm sorry,' he protested, 'I was thinking&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'My poor boy, you don't go to the play to think.
What on earth were you thinking about?'
</p>

<p>
Now, one of Archie's habits which more than any
other unfitted him for polite society was his tendency
to tell the truth.  So now he blurted out, 'I was
thinking you'd miss all this in Edinburgh.'
</p>

<p>
Norah's delicate eyebrows rose, and her lips
tightened.
</p>

<p>
'What's that about Edinburgh, Archie?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, some day we must settle down to work.'
</p>

<p>
'But, my poor friend, why Edinburgh? what's
wrong with East Ham?'
</p>

<p>
'You know.  Family connection, and all that.
Solicitors.  I wouldn't have a chance at the London
Bar; now, at Edinburgh, in five years&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, darling, go on&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'In five or six years I ought to be clearing at least
five hundred a year.'
</p>

<p>
'Say it again slowly, Archie....  You don't
seriously mean to shut me up for five or six years in
Edinburgh to earn five hundred a year!  Why, I'd
sooner be bricked into a convent wall!'
</p>

<p>
'Edinburgh's not a bad place; we'd know lots of
people there.'
</p>

<p>
'The same applies to hell, dear.'  And so the
argument went on, Archie more and more obstinate,
and Norah more outrageous.  Archie was determined
that his only safe prospect was the Bar and the
Scottish Bar at that.  The Bar might be slow, but,
for him, it was sure, and success was only a question
of time.  Norah urged him to chance his arm at
something quicker, more lucrative, and in London.
She quoted the successful among her friends whom
post-war poverty had driven to work.
</p>

<p>
'Look at Bobby Anstruther.  His garage is
making three thousand a year, hiring out defunct
Daimlers.  You have to book one days ahead.'
</p>

<p>
'He'll be bust in a year when every one's spent
their money.'
</p>

<p>
Well, look at young Peter Carey, making thousands
on the Stock Exchange.  And what about that
Rhodesian man we met at dinner to-night?  He said
there were pots of money to be made in mealies in
Africa.  He said any fool could grow them.'
</p>

<p>
'Not in London?'
</p>

<p>
'No, darling.  But if I can't be in London, I'd
rather be in Jericho or Tierra del Fuego than in a
blasted provincial town.  Listen, Archie,' and she
went on to repeat what the South African had told
her, how the Chartered Company were giving tracts
of 3000 acres in Northern Rhodesia to approved
ex-officers, free for the asking, provided they
occupied and worked them.
</p>

<p>
Archie shook his head.  'I might be able to make
farming pay,' he said, 'I was brought up on a farm.
But it's a hard life, and, in spite of your friend, it's
slow money.  You'd like it worse than Edinburgh
and the Bar.'
</p>

<p>
'If you mention Edinburgh or the Bar again, I'll
tell the head waiter that I don't know who you are,
and you've accosted me.'
</p>

<p>
Then with one of her sudden changes of moods:
</p>

<p>
'Archie, I'm sorry.  I'm being a beast to you to-night.
I don't mean to be, dear, but I'm tired, and
Edinburgh ... say you forgive me, darling, and
I won't say another word about it.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But Norah had got her toes in and her husband's
opposition to the African plan only made her dig
them in deeper.  Though Archie was as obstinate as
they make them, his will was weakened by his
anxiety to please his wife.  Like most men, he was
attracted by the idea of an outdoor life; but that
northern pre-vision of the disadvantages of any
agreeable course, held him back, and by birth and
breeding he was mistrustful of anything new and
unproven.  Moreover, he did not believe that Norah
would like the life.
</p>

<p>
She herself had no doubts.  Her restless, adventurous
hands grasped at anything fresh and strange.
Of all the siren lands that had lured her girlhood,
Africa's voice had rung the clearest.  Women and
the lower animals do not reason.  Pictures present
themselves before their minds, and they choose as
the pictures entice or repel.
</p>

<p>
So as she re-read the travels of the great adventurers,
she saw a sunlit vision of palms and orchids,
savages as noble as princes, and as faithful as dogs,
wild beasts to be hunted at pleasure, lands of mystery
to be explored at will, fortunes to be won in the
intervals as a diver gathers pearls.  And at the end
a triumphant return to the luxury of home with
spoils that would lay London at her feet.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Her final storming of Archie's opposition was
characteristic.  She had driven him to his last line
of defence&mdash;a plea of insufficient capital.  Had
Archie ever understood women, he would have
known the danger of setting up one concrete objection.
She put on her furs and an hour later returned
with a handful of banknotes.
</p>

<p>
'Where did this come from?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'My pearls,' was the reply.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"That is the way they always defeat us," said Ross.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
One day, towards the end of the dry season in
Central Africa more than two years later,
Norah was sitting on an empty packing-case under
the shade of an acacia, watching the tiling of her
house.
</p>

<p>
Archie had been two years building it.  He was
so thorough that he sometimes maddened her.
Moreover, every brick and tile had to be moulded
and burnt on the farm; anthill clay for mortar dug
and carried; shells for lime pointing dredged from
the river and burnt in kilns; timber felled, dragged
and hand sawn; doors and windows made in the
shop; bolts and iron work wrought in the forge; and
natives taught to do all this.
</p>

<p>
At last the white walls were up, the verandah
pillars stood square and solid, and the skeleton of
the king post roof reared its symmetry across the
cloudless blue sky.  A string of naked black urchins
herded by an objurgatory black capitao formed a
chattering procession carrying tiles, two in each hand
and one on each head, to the tile hangers, who
crouched like black apes on the rafters.
</p>

<p>
Norah felt no elation at the thought of good work
nearly done, and stared blankly across a prospect
of profitless and laborious years.  True, she would
be heartily glad to be quit of her temporary habitation
of the last thirty months.  From where she sat,
she could see the cluster of wattle-and-daub
rondavels, where they lived while the permanent house
was building.  It was across a little river that ran
swift as a mill race, bordered by marshy banks
hidden in papyrus rushes with heads like mops.
Waterfowl, black, white, and grey, rose into the air
from time to time with harsh, melancholy cries.  On
either bank of the river lay the flats, where grew
the dry season grass for Archie's cattle.  The edge
of the bush, as straight as if drawn with a ruler,
fringed the flats.  Desolation gained her when she
thought how many square miles of trees lay between
her and her nearest white neighbour.  Beyond the
tops of the trees she could see the rounded slopes
of the hills, blue in the distance, as bright as a child's
painting.
</p>

<p>
On the flats, which stayed green when the scanty
grass of the bush had turned orange, she could see
Archie's beloved herds and, going his rounds, looking
out for sick and ailing beasts, Archie himself.
To-day the disreputable grey double terai had for
company a dirty white topee.  A wandering 'stiff' had
descended on the farm some evenings before with a
ulendo[<a id="chap0104fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn1">1</a>] of two carriers.  They had few visitors, a
dozen or two in the year, traders, missionaries,
Boma[<a id="chap0104fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0104fn2">2</a>] officials, and occasionally a 'stiff,' some
unfortunate with insufficient kit and carriers, his
presence in the country imperfectly explained by an
ostensible search for work where none was to be
found.  Such were usually chary of giving their
names or their business.  This one, a wizened little
fellow with a half-hearted beard and a game leg,
answered, when he remembered, to the name of
Jones, and purported to have come from the Congo,
over whose frontier he admitted to have been escorted
by Belgian askari.  He had a repertory of elephant
stories and tales of tusks of incredible size, but
became elusive if pressed as to locality.  He was now,
no doubt, giving Archie a wealth of inexpert advice
on the treatment of cattle, and Norah smiled as she
imagined the impenetrable silence with which it
would be received.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Archie had proved to have a knack with cattle.
Brought up on the farm his mother had inherited,
he had learnt a good deal of veterinary work in the
gunners.  The herd of native cattle he had collected
was as good as any in the country, and for grass his
farm was unrivalled.  But lack of markets and the
distance from rail-head, which made freight
prohibitive and the amenities of civilisation rare, held
him up.  The only market which was not at the
moment barred by the embargoes of God or
man&mdash;tsetse fly belts or prohibited areas&mdash;was the
Katanga, the district of the Congo copper mines,
whose vast compounds of native workers consumed
unlimited meat.  The depreciated Belgian exchange,
however, made it unprofitable for Archie to sell
there.  So, while his herds increased and multiplied,
his bank balance, under the constant drain of
working expenses, ebbed.
</p>

<p>
The cattle were already streaming to their
kraals on the high ground.  Amid the shouting of
the herd-boys, they snatched at a last bite of grass
as they shouldered their way and a little mist of
dust rose from their hoofs.  Norah got up with a
sigh as the sun sank behind the darkened hills.
Cattle attract lions and leopards, and it was not
safe for man or domestic beast to be abroad after
dark.
</p>

<p>
She reached the ferry and stepped into the
dug-out canoe, manned by an elderly native with a
withered leg, whom Archie employed from charity.
He pointed the nose of the canoe up-stream and
pushed off.  Carried by the current, the boat swung
round and bumped into the rough steps on the
farther bank.  She sprang out bidding good-night to
the old man, who knelt down and clapped his hands
in salutation.
</p>

<p>
Archie had not reached the rondavels before her;
he would be seeing the cattle safely kraaled for the
night.  Her 'boy,' Changalilo, brought quinine and
silently prepared a hip-bath for her.
</p>

<p>
Silence, discretion, and resource, were Changalilo's
rare qualifications.  His tribe, the Awemba, a
dignified, well-mannered, and once warlike race, are
as a rule too irresponsible to make good servants.
Norah explained the exception that was Changalilo
by attributing to him Arab blood.  His lips and jaw
showed no trace of negroid thickness, and it was
likely enough that in passage some Arab slave trader
had sired one of his parents.
</p>

<p>
His slimness and his white kanju made him look
taller than he really was, and his grave restrained
manner lent him an aloofness which was probably
absent from his simple heart.  Now he lingered in
the room soundlessly creating an impression, as
native courtesy directs, that there was something more
to be said.
</p>

<p>
'What is it, Changalilo?' asked Norah.
</p>

<p>
'Io, mwkai&mdash;nothing, mistress,' came the
disclaimer imposed by good form on any speaker with
news to impart.
</p>

<p>
Further interrogation elicited the fact that the
sukambali, a lad of fourteen who hewed wood, drew
water, and washed plates, stated that his father was
ill, and that he wanted to go to his village.
</p>

<p>
'Is it true?' asked Norah.
</p>

<p>
Changalilo's silence indicated scepticism.
</p>

<p>
'In any case, he cannot start to-night,' she decided.
</p>

<p>
This was just her luck, with a guest in the house.
She supposed she would have to let the little beast
go, and of course another sukambali would appear
in a day or two, but work in the kitchen would be
completely disorganised.  Unless she cooked with
her own hands, food would be uneatable.  How she
hated housewifery.  She had to do it, though.
Archie took over the whole work of the farm, and
the house fell to her share.
</p>

<p>
Her days seemed a round of ignoble detail&mdash;thwarting
the table-boy's appetite for sugar, driving
the sukambali to wash the saucepans before they
were used, giving out paraffin, and watching that it
was not stolen from the lamps.  That's what
pioneering meant.  Well, she must stick it now.  She
promised Changalilo she would interview the
sukambali on the morrow, and dismissed him.  There
was a sound of inharmonious humming outside, and
Archie entered.  He was in good spirits, his day's
work done, and his visitor bestowed for the moment
in the guest house.  Norah, forcing a smile, inquired
dutifully after the farm.
</p>

<p>
'Wasted most of the day listening to Jones'
rubbish,' was the reply.  'He knows more about
elephant than cattle.  I hope so, anyhow.  Telling me
how to control the sex of calves.  Pure superstition,
of course.  His theory is that...'  But Norah was
not listening.  Her gaze wandered from a patch in
the bulging wall, where the stakes showed through
the dull red mud, to the sagging thatch of the
ceilingless roof, whence insects were liable to drop.  Her
mind contrasted this unromantic squalor with the
spacious poverty of her own home, and with the
splendour of her London days, exaggerated, no
doubt, across the two-year gap of barren makeshift.
Bravely, she forced the picture out of her mind and
bent her attention to Archie's monosyllabic conversation.
</p>

<p>
'I think,' he was saying, 'I ought to see to getting
another pure bred bull to build up the herd a bit.'
</p>

<p>
At the familiar words 'build up the herd' Norah's
restraint snapped.  When you consider that she had
loyally suppressed her feelings for over two years,
perhaps her outburst may be forgiven her.
</p>

<p>
'What's the good of building up the precious herd,
when you can't sell the brutes?  Do you think I've
come to live like a Hottentot in this desert to watch
you acting midwife to a lot of humpbacked African
cows for their sakes?  I never see you all day, except
at meals when you're eating, and in the evenings,
when you're sleeping.  I believe you think more of
your heifers than you do of your wife.'
</p>

<p>
Slowly Archie answered.
</p>

<p>
'It's the only safe line, Norah.  If we build
up...' he checked himself in time.  'We've got
the best herd in the country and it's getting better
all the time.  When times are normal, we'll sell
well.  It'll be easier for you in the new house, and
it's only a question of time....'
</p>

<p>
'So's life, Archie, only a question of time.  Three
score years and ten of it, isn't it?  And I've had
twenty-four already.  How long do you want us
to go on?'
</p>

<p>
But you can supply without my help the stock
complaints of an over-wrought woman.
</p>

<p>
The storm ended unusually for Norah in tears.
Silently, Archie tried to soothe her.  He was
thinking harder than he had for many a day.  Constant
manual work leaves little room for thought.
Typically, he gave no utterance to his meditation.  He
liked to work things out in his mind, bring his
matured plan to a successful issue, and then, and not
till then, announce his conclusion.  That was his
habit, and he pursued it now.  Had he told Norah
his thoughts, well, it would have spoiled my story
and saved a life.
</p>

<p>
As it was, Norah retired to bed with her nerves
in shreds, and Archie dined alone with his nomadic
guest, whom a string of 'sundowners' seemed to
stimulate.  His shrill voice was audible through the
mud walls till a late hour.  Archie talked more than
his wont, and seemed to be asking questions.  Only
once were any words distinguishable.
</p>

<p>
'It's a bargain,' said Mr. Jones of the Congo.
</p>

<p>
Next morning at dawn she was awakened by an
unusual bustle.  She supposed that their visitor had
decided to decamp and that Archie was hospitably
supplying him with the many necessaries he lacked,
before speeding him on his way.  She did not feel
her presence was necessary at that ceremony, nor did
she as yet want to meet Archie.  She was sorry for
last night's outburst because it must have hurt him.
The look in his eyes had nearly checked her words.
But if he cared for her, as his eyes seemed to say,
as he once had cared for her, why did his words,
his actions never show it now?  He never asked
her advice, sought her help.  She had become part
of his daily life, part of the farm, like Simoni, the
ploughman.  Well, one must expect six years of
marriage to kill love, though it seemed a little hard
that youth too should be wasted.  But it wasn't
fair to say things that hurt Archie.  She must make
it up to him for last night.  But not now: she lacked
courage to pretend at this time in the morning.
And if Archie said the wrong thing she would give
herself away, and hurt him afresh.  So when he
knocked at her door, she lay very still, and shammed
sleep.  He knocked twice, and hung about for some
minutes, apparently undecided whether to make
another onslaught.  Then his steps receded, and the
bustle died away.
</p>

<p>
When at length she came out to breakfast, wearing
a flame coloured jumper that was a favourite
of Archie's, she found neither of the men.
Changalilo, standing at attention behind her chair,
presented the following literary effort:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'<i>Dearest, have started for Elizabethville on cattle
business.  Will write from there.  Jones is here.</i>&mdash;ARCHIE.'"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0105"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Naturally, Norah was furious.  Any one
would be furious who was denied the doing
of a gracious deed already rehearsed in mind.
</p>

<p>
She had come to breakfast with a generous act of
submission, and an affectionate reconciliation
prepared.  The sort of thing that closes the story on
the screen, but, alas! ends little in real life.  And
now Archie had gone without a word on 'cattle
business,' to buy, that meant, the pure bred bull that
had made the mischief&mdash;neglecting as if it had never
been made, her protest.  He hadn't even noticed that
she was miserable; or if he had noticed, he hadn't
cared.  Last night's scene was now transfigured into
a declaration of wrongs, a declaration brutally
ignored.  But wait till Archie came back with his
bull, she'd make him take her into account; she
wouldn't stay a day longer on the farm; if need be,
alone she'd go back to a decent life in a decent
country.
</p>

<p>
In this mood she finished her breakfast and walked
out into the chequered sunlight of the forest behind
the rondavels.  Changalilo, obeying Archie's
standing order, slipped after her with her rifle on his
shoulder.  They passed the sawpit and galvanised
into momentary activity the sawyers, who were
celebrating Archie's absence with a morning of idleness
over a fire of sticks.
</p>

<p>
She climbed a rocky hill, whose eminence gave her
a view above the all-surrounding trees, which, from
the level, limited sight to a matter of yards.  Looking
over the carpet of tree tops, whose leaves at that
season had taken the transparent colour of azalea
flowers, she watched the shadows of the clouds
marbling the distant hillside, reflecting that her life was
as useless as yonder succession of light and shade.
Presently Changalilo, in whose eyes a hill top
was useful to locate game or landmarks, and who
cared little for scenery or meditation, announced
the approach of a 'ulendo wa musungu' (a travelling
white man and his carriers).
</p>

<p>
Norah's slower eyes searched the forest in vain.
But soon on a path that wound between the trees
appeared a native with a hip-bath on his head.
More natives, carrying on head or shoulder bundles
of tents and bedding, boxes of food and kitchen
utensils, straggled into sight at irregular intervals.
As they approached, appearing and disappearing
among the trees, Norah wondered who the traveller
could be.  It was rare to have two visitors in so
short a space, but as there was no other white
settlement for several days' journey, the traveller would
certainly make a halt at the farm.
</p>

<p>
It was not Henderson, the Native Commissioner,
for she would have seen him before his bath, walking
ahead of his carriers on the look-out for game.
The bath and the camp gear were too new for old
Palmer, the trader, making his round of inspection
of native storemen.  If it were Father Dupont, of
the French Fathers, she would not have expected
a bath at all.
</p>

<p>
The deductive methods of Mr. Sherlock Holmes
failing her, she decided to see for herself.  Scrambling
downhill, through the litter of grey sandstone,
split apart by trunks of trees, and crowned with
euphorbias, she reached the path before the wayfarer
had come in sight, and since conventions, even of
the English, are sometimes superseded in lonely
places, she advanced some way along it to meet
him.
</p>

<p>
Where the path swerved to avoid a big mupundu
tree, she found him.  A tall young man, leaning on
a stick, whipped off his sun helmet and grasped
her hand.
</p>

<p>
She noticed that his hair curled and caught the
sun.  She noticed that his clothes, the ordinary
clothes of a ulendo&mdash;khaki shirt and shorts, puttees
and heavy boots&mdash;were newer than that part of the
country generally saw.  He bore himself with an
air, and two tall natives at his back, shouldering
guns, added a pleasantly piratical touch.
</p>

<p>
'My name's Ward,' he said.  'You must be Lady
Norah Sinclair, whom I've heard so much about.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know who from!' she laughed.
</p>

<p>
'Every one, since I landed at Cape Town,' he
asserted, looking at her fixedly.
</p>

<p>
'They haven't forgotten how to tell pleasant lies
in England,' she smiled back.  'I'll bet you never
heard of our existence, till you stopped with the
White Fathers on the Chambezi, three days'
journey back.'
</p>

<p>
'I assure you,' he began, then broke off.  'Anyhow,
<i>you've</i> forgotten my existence.'
</p>

<p>
She stared at him.  A light dawned.
</p>

<p>
'You looked different in pyjamas,' she said, and
the flood of reminiscence burst.  He had crashed
at Brooklands in 1914, and lain for a fortnight in
her ward.  She remembered, amused, how his eyes
had followed her about the room, and his boyish
efforts to make conversation.  She had liked him
and was sorry when he was moved to another
hospital.
</p>

<p>
'This is the most marvellous thing that ever
happened,' he exclaimed.  'How can we celebrate
it in the forest?'
</p>

<p>
'Only lunch, I'm afraid,' she said.  'It's ready
on the farm.  My husband's away on ulendo'&mdash;at
the memory her temper flamed&mdash;'but we'll manage
alone.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks awfully,' he said, and limped alongside
of her.  I don't know whether his wound had
stiffened during the halt, but he leaned more heavily
on his stick.
</p>

<p>
'You're lame,' she remarked.
</p>

<p>
Ward explained that he had been bitten on the
foot by some anonymous insect, and the day's march
had rubbed the wound into a sore.
</p>

<p>
'It's an awful nuisance on ulendo,' he added, and
then&mdash;Dick was never the lad to lose anything for
want of trying&mdash;'I'd been meaning, as I came along,
to ask your husband to put me up for a couple of
days, till I was right.'
</p>

<p>
Norah considered Dick for a moment, as women
can, without looking at him.  She had liked him
well in hospital days and had been flattered by
his obvious adoration.  Then the changes and
chances of life had wiped his picture clean from
her mind till now his presence brought up details
buried seven years deep&mdash;his bed in the corner of
the ward, a passing irritation at a pretty girl's visit,
the chrysanthemums she left.
</p>

<p>
She made up her mind.
</p>

<p>
'Mrs. Grundy hasn't got farther north than the
railway will take her,' she said.  'You'll find a rest
camp all ready by the new house across the river.
You'll come over to meals, of course,' she added
as his face fell.  She felt a momentary awkwardness
and changed the conversation to shooting, of
which she said she did not get as much as she
liked, since Archie could not often spare the time,
and did not like her going far afield alone.
</p>

<p>
'You must let me take you out,' Ward interrupted.
</p>

<p>
'But what about your foot?' said Norah innocently.
</p>

<p>
She explained that she always wanted to invite
her relations from England for shooting trips, but
her husband could not leave his work to meet them
at rail-head, and take them about the country.
</p>

<p>
'A farmer's wife sees a different side of Central
Africa to the traveller who makes a short shooting
trip to a good game area and goes back to London
to write a book about it.'
</p>

<p>
'Is that one for me?' asked Ward penitently.
</p>

<p>
'No, one for myself,' she sighed, 'before I came
out I believed it all.'
</p>

<p>
So Norah chattered on.  She did not get much
chattering on the farm.  Her rare visitors, if women,
talked about recipes and jam making.  The men
talked of game or natives.  If Dick was a ghost
from the past, ghosts can be very entertaining.  And
he was handsomer than ever.
</p>

<p>
Dick thought the same of Norah.  Norah, in the
formality of V.A.D. uniform, was only less
fascinating than Norah in the boyishness of her farm
wear&mdash;silk shirt open at the neck, breeches and
canvas leggings.  In Dick's opinion most women
he had seen in breeches looked either bulbous or
cinematographical; Norah was a twentieth century
hamadryad&mdash;cool and restrained, save for her
narrow eyes and her short dark hair that bubbled out
from under her wide grey hat.  The sun had burnt
her neck to the colour of coffee and cream, but her
arms still hinted at the whiteness of her body.
</p>

<p>
Dick could not keep his eyes off her.
</p>

<p>
'Lunch will be foul,' she was saying.  'My <i>suk</i>
has gone to bury his father.'
</p>

<p>
'Why don't you take over mine?' Dick pressed her.
</p>

<p>
'D'you mean it?  <i>Suk</i>-snatching isn't beyond me.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course I mean it!  And, look here, do give
your household a chance of getting straight and
dine with me to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'Love to!' said Norah.
</p>

<p>
For the next three days Dick laid close siege
to Norah's heart.  Such siege of a woman alone on
a lonely farm may not have been scrupulous.  But
when did Venus teach scruples?  Her reputation
was ill enough in the old Island years, and her latter
day registration, under the Anglo-Saxon name of
Natural Selection, has changed nothing.
</p>

<p>
The dinner was Dick's first move, and an intelligent
one.  The hours that succeeded it before
Norah's eyes closed in forgetfulness testified its
success.  After the roseate glow of the Pommery,
with which Dick's admirable table boy had plied
her, had worn off, her mind still lingered among
golden moments.
</p>

<p>
'I won't insult you with an iceless cocktail?' he
had said.
</p>

<p>
'My last drink,' she retorted, 'was the mead the
White Fathers brew at the Chambezi!'
</p>

<p>
'That curious compound of honey and fermented
mealies?'
</p>

<p>
'The local gourmets walk a hundred miles to drink it.'
</p>

<p>
Dinner started, for the dweller in cities banally
enough, with hors-d'&oelig;uvres.  To Norah's reluctant
rusticity, the tinned caviare shone with an unforgotten
aura of shaded restaurant lamps, the bottled
anchovies swam in a remembered sea of laughter
and wit, the dried olives echoed with the lost lilt
of ragtime orchestras.
</p>

<p>
There was no bathos in the courses that followed.
</p>

<p>
'Who cooks for you?' she asked.  'The angel
Gabriel?'
</p>

<p>
'Is it hard to get cooks up here?' he replied innocently.
</p>

<p>
'Yesterday I found Alabedi rolling a rissole into
shape on his naked chest,' she said.  'The one before
used to wash his feet in the big saucepan.'
</p>

<p>
'The chef at the Ritz may have the same
weaknesses,' put in Dick sympathetically.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, but he can at least cook.  My criminals
haven't an idea above "shtoo!"'
</p>

<p>
After dinner they sat in a shelter, fragrant with
the fresh leaves and blossoms of the boughs that
formed it.
</p>

<p>
'What about a tune?' asked Dick, as his personal
boy, resplendent in white kanju and scarlet
sash, presented a book of gramophone records.
</p>

<p>
'You choose,' she said, 'it's so long, since...'
</p>

<p>
Dick judged the jewelled eroticism of Puccini
opportune; but when it was over...
</p>

<p>
'In my young days,' she commented, 'there wasn't
any opera.  It was thought rather German.  Do put
on a fox-trot.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know that one,' she said at the end.  'Of
course,' she added.
</p>

<p>
Dick searched, and found a one-step that dated
back to the war.
</p>

<p>
She sighed.  'There's nothing that reminds like
a tune.  I take it the Recording Angel keeps a list
of all one's most pricelessly associated tunes, and has
them played to one in hell.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm sorry.  I didn't think&mdash;&mdash;' he lied.
</p>

<p>
'What is there on the back?  Yes, let's have
that.  How sick one was of it!'
</p>

<p>
When the commonplace little tune was played,
'I can't bear any more,' she said.  'Give me a
cigarette.  If it's a "flag" I'll burst into tears.'
</p>

<p>
It wasn't, and they talked&mdash;or he told her&mdash;of
dances, theatres, the marriages and divorces of their
mutual friends and enemies.
</p>

<p>
'How soon do you go back?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'That depends on&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
She did not give him time to say on whom it
depended.
</p>

<p>
'And where do you go on to from here?'
</p>

<p>
He was vague.  He was short of provisions.
['I'm sure I've eaten three years of pâté de foies
gras to-night,' she interrupted.]  He had to hang
about for fresh supplies to catch him.
</p>

<p>
He brought the conversation round, by way of
shops, to her frock, which he admired discreetly.
He compared it favourably with the clothes they
were now wearing in London.
</p>

<p>
'Two and a half years old,' she said.  'If I had
the choice between an hour's talk with Paul Poiret
or St.  Paul, I wouldn't bother to learn Hebrew.'
</p>

<p>
'Where are your nearest shops?'
</p>

<p>
'There's a store three days' walk away, where
you can buy white calico, or blue calico with white
spots, and mouth organs or looking-glasses.'
</p>

<p>
'I think you're marvellous,' he said.  'Not many
women...'
</p>

<p>
She did not answer, but Dick, watching closely,
saw her breast rise in an involuntary sigh.
</p>

<p>
She sighed again as she lay sleepless, reckoning
relentlessly what her bond to Archie would cost
her.  That loyalty was costing her youth, beauty,
health; it exacted all, and gave nothing.  She
pictured herself in five years' time.  Still young,
as lives go, but her looks perished, her skin dried
with the glare and sagging with the heat, her mind
ruralised, her interests dwindled.
</p>

<p>
If she had still loved Archie, she would have
thrown all this at his feet, as carelessly as she had
risked her life for him.  But her passion had
vanished, had followed her illusion, in an almost
unnoticed, almost painless decease, killed by some
inward unsoundness, some hidden cancer or
malnutrition.  And to-day Archie had proved his entire
dissociation from her.
</p>

<p>
The same morning, as if sent by the Devil, had
appeared an Adonis, whose words, whose eyes
proclaimed an interest, a devotion that was ready to
flame into...
</p>

<p>
But her word bound her to Archie, and by her
word she abode.  With more reason than many of
her generation, Norah had no clear religious or
moral principles.  Her mother had died when she
was born, and her father knew his way about
Ruff's Guide better than the Bible.  But loyalty
was a class virtue that she had not escaped, and
for the first of many sleepless nights during the
two unhappy years, she began to probe its foundations.
No doubt the shade of Dick, cool, handsome,
debonair, encouraged her.
</p>

<p>
To what Moloch had Archie offered her loyalty?
</p>

<p>
To this fetish of a farm which swallowed all his
money, thoughts, energy.  On the same altar were
laid her heritage by sex and class of careless, elegant
living; her place in the life of the day; all that
her youth demanded.
</p>

<p>
And now Archie had proved that he despised her
sacrifice.  He did not even refuse her claims so long
choked back, combat her protest voiced at last.  It
was sufficient to ignore them."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help feeling," said Ross, "that Archie's
idiotic taciturnity almost earned him Norah's defection.
</p>

<p>
Had he been able to overcome his distaste for
expression&mdash;emotion he called it; had he tried to
conquer his passion for finishing a job before he
mentioned it; had he, in short, told Norah that he
was going to Elizabethville to sell his herd in order
to satisfy her wishes and take her back to England,
Dick Ward would never have secured foothold in
her heart.
</p>

<p>
Instead, Archie held his tongue and left the field
to the Devil and to Dick."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0106"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
These made the most of their chance.
</p>

<p>
In the red, leather-bound volume of
aphorisms which accompanied Dick in his wanderings,
he found a remark of Balzac's which seemed
to him full of promise:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Dans le monde de la realité,' that thinker had
apparently concluded, 'comme dans le monde des
fées, la femme appartient toujours à celui qui sait
arriver à elle et la délivrer de la situation où elle
languit.'
</p>

<p>
Here was the situation, here the woman languished,
here was Dick ready for the part of Fairy
Prince.
</p>

<p>
He reflected with satisfaction that while the
heroine of fairy stories may very suitably be
shepherdess, goose girl, beggar maid, the hero is
inevitably a prince&mdash;never a cattle breeder.  Did this not
hint the triumph of Court over Farm, Athens over
B&oelig;otia, Capital over Colony?
</p>

<p>
If Dick was no prince, he was young, amusing,
good-looking, rich enough to wander in comfort
about Africa and bold enough to call such wandering
'exploration' (at any rate to the journalists at
Southampton).  The omens were favourable.
</p>

<p>
Dinner the first evening had been planned to
suggest a tacit comparison between Norah's present
lot and the world of civilised luxury whose gate his
kiss would open.
</p>

<p>
He had shown Africa in damaging contrast with
Europe.  Now he applied himself to set the lover
in high relief against the husband.
</p>

<p>
Too clever for tangible disparagement that would
challenge Norah's loyalty, Dick applied himself
silently to supply all that Archie in two years had
left undone.  Dick's 'boy' hung the pictures that
had stood, faces wallwards, for eighteen months;
Dick stretched an insect-proof ceiling of calico that
he took from his stores of presents for headmen;
Dick's carriers dug and levelled the flower garden
that Archie had always promised 'next season.'
</p>

<p>
His long limbs and cool, unhurried gestures, his
well-cut white flannels, and the faint swagger with
which he wore them, had the unquestioned advantage
of Archie's unremarkable presence.
</p>

<p>
In long tête-à-têtes he exerted all his charm of
manner and person.
</p>

<p>
An afternoon when Nature seemed to work for
him was the shooting expedition that he had promised.
In deference to the foot, which furnished the
excuse of his stay, it was decided to paddle down
river to the flats where puku grazed and where at
nightfall duck flighted.
</p>

<p>
Papyrus met over their heads in a tunnel of green
silence, that the plash of a paddle hardly broke.
</p>

<p>
'If this would never end,' sighed Dick.
</p>

<p>
Norah shrugged her shoulders.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  '"Momentary as a sound,<br />
  Swift as a shadow, short as any dream,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
she quoted, as the stream bore them out into the
daylight.
</p>

<p>
A bird like a black ibis, rigid and heraldic on the
bank that here was firm and covered with short
turf, kept jealous watch on the surface of the water.
Their silent passage barely disturbed his fishing.
Half-way between the river and the straight edge
of the bush a pair of Karongo crane, true season
after season to each other and their haunts, promenaded
the flats.  Their long necks swayed to their
leisurely, fastidious stride.
</p>

<p>
The old boatman with the withered leg, who stood
in the stern, bent forward and whispered excitedly.
</p>

<p>
'He can see a herd of puku,' said Norah.
</p>

<p>
Crouching low in the boat beneath the level of
the bank, they drifted till a bend of the river brought
them into long range.  Peeping cautiously from
behind a tuft of amatete reeds, Norah watched the
little red-brown cluster of buck.
</p>

<p>
Five lengths ahead of his ewes the ram was grazing.
Ever and again up jerked his head and he
stood, broad-chested and solid, his mild eyes
distended, his wet nostrils snuffing, alert for sign, scent,
or sound.  Then his head would sink and, reassured,
he took up his grazing, moving onward as he fed.
</p>

<p>
Dick cocked his rifle and pushed it into Norah's
hand.
</p>

<p>
'Now's your chance,' he whispered.
</p>

<p>
Norah shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'Too far for me,' she breathed.  'I don't want
to wound.'
</p>

<p>
Helped by Dick, whose fingers lingered on her
arm, she clambered up the bank, and began to creep
on her knees, circling that the breeze might not
carry her scent to the herd.  But for all her care,
the ram was uneasy.  At shorter intervals his head
jerked up, causing Norah each time to flatten herself
to the ground.
</p>

<p>
Whether at last they caught her scent or whether
general principles of caution prevailed, at some
invisible sign from their leader the herd started into
a skeltering gallop.  The ground drummed under
their hoofs until they came to a strip where reeds
concealed a little marsh.  There the red bodies
emerged and disappeared with the bounding motion
of rocking-horses.  On the farther side they paused,
long necks stretched, wide eyes astare.  Then they
fell quietly to grazing.
</p>

<p>
'I'm three parts glad I didn't get a shot,' said
Norah, as she rejoined the canoe.
</p>

<p>
Dick commended her gentleness.
</p>

<p>
'Puku are such gallant little chaps,' she said, 'and
they take such a lot of killing.  Archie wounded
one that dropped after she had run a mile.  When
they cut her up, they found the bullet in her heart."
</p>

<p>
This gave Dick a chance to talk about the state
in which at an autopsy his heart would be found.
</p>

<p>
Norah laughed.  'You'll have forgotten I exist
by the time you've been a week in London,' she
prophesied.
</p>

<p>
Dick said this was hardly fair.  It was seven years
since he'd seen her last, and all the time...
</p>

<p>
'Anyhow it took you a good few minutes to
recognise me in the bush,' she reminded him.
</p>

<p>
'But you'd grown more lovely yet,' he protested.
'And in breeches....'
</p>

<p>
The river had widened out into a sort of lake.
Reeds grew up through the water and blue lotuses
starred its surface.  A couple of small red-headed
moorhens bobbed up from under the broad leaves as
if they were made of cork.
</p>

<p>
This is a good place to wait for the duck to
come over,' said Norah, and Dick fixed his twelve
bore.
</p>

<p>
The sunlight had turned from white through gold
to ochre.  A few frogs had tentatively begun to
croak.  Too near the equator for twilight, it was
Africa's <i>heure du berger</i>.
</p>

<p>
Dick began to talk.  From what Norah told me,
his themes seem to have dated from the early earnest
years of the century.  He pleaded the right of the
Natural Mate over the Legal Spouse; he urged the
barrenness of constancy Where Love is Not; he
suggested that the world might be Well Lost for Love.
And so on.  For my part I never could see why 'All
for Love' is a respectable sentiment and a subject
for epics and tragedies, while other equally
whole-hearted passions and sacrifices, say, 'All for Money'
or 'for Food' are discredited.  However, that's an
opinion that neither Norah nor Dick shared.
</p>

<p>
Norah, of course, wasn't convinced by Dick's
eloquence&mdash;no woman ever listened to what her
lover said.  But passion is as infectious as small-pox,
and, if it lasts no longer, leaves no lighter scars.  So,
reluctantly on that perfect evening, her conscience
gave ground and Dick's words began to reach her
heart and his nearness her senses.
</p>

<p>
'Don't miss the best part of life,' he adjured her.
</p>

<p>
'Life looks its best from behind.'
</p>

<p>
'It isn't for any one as young and lovely to say
that.  Be brave, take a chance....'
</p>

<p>
This was perilous advice for the gambler's daughter.
</p>

<p>
'Supposing I wanted to take a chance ... with
you, don't you see I've promised...'
</p>

<p>
'Are you willing to waste your whole life for two
words mumbled in Hanover Square?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be melodramatic, Dick!'
</p>

<p>
'It isn't melodrama, it's tragedy!  Norah, come
away with me, Norah....'
</p>

<p>
Just then the duck came over, and winging swiftly
against the sunset, interrupted Dick's eloquence.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the third evening Dick, progressing from
words to action, forced her to decision.  The sun
had set and Norah was still sitting out of doors
protected from wild beasts by a lamp on the table
and by a gun at her feet.  The lowing of the cattle
had abated and the thud of their feet as they
shouldered into the kraals had ceased.  The air was
heavy with spring and with the fleshy scent of the
wild magnolias that overhung the river.
</p>

<p>
She knew it was time to go indoors, but any effort
seemed intolerable.  The harsh chorus of frogs in
the marshes alone broke the silence.  She sat on.  A
moth, as big as a swallow, brushed against her cheek,
causing her to look up.  A yellow light across the
river caught her eye.  'Dick's camp fire,' she
thought, and let her imagination play.  But as she
gazed she knew she was mistaken, for the light was
dodging and swaying nearer.  It was a hurricane
lamp crossing the river.  It could only be carried by
Dick, and he was coming over to her.
</p>

<p>
She did not feel glad or sorry, but waited in inert
prostration before an oncoming fate.  The night
denied motion, and she was held in a snare waiting
the coming of the fowler.  Her heart began to beat
faster.  A drum started to throb in a distant village
and her blood seemed to pulse in time.  Dick's lamp
was an intolerable way off, so were the tropical
stars, so was reality.  Her world was that insistent
drum and her galloping pulses.
</p>

<p>
At last she heard Dick's footsteps on the leaves.
Without a word he lowered himself into the chair
beside her and for a long time sat in silence, his face
in the shadow.
</p>

<p>
'What holds you here?' he asked at last.
</p>

<p>
'Say "who" rather?' her deep voice replied,
resenting the effort of speech.
</p>

<p>
'The flowers blossom and die in your forests,' he
went on, 'and no man sees them.'
</p>

<p>
'Poetry!' she laughed.  'This is prose and daily
bread.'
</p>

<p>
He groped after her mood.
</p>

<p>
'You could have poetry and cake.'
</p>

<p>
She threw up her head laughing and he saw where
the sunburn stopped on her neck.
</p>

<p>
'Wedding cake?' she asked mischievously.
</p>

<p>
'If I'm not an angel, I'm not an absolute rotter,'
he said quickly.
</p>

<p>
'It wouldn't have mattered in any case,' she
murmured, 'if...'
</p>

<p>
'If what?'
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.  In the distance the drum
pounded on, inciting to the dance some isolated
community of black men, sentient only of the
whips of hunger and desire.  She wondered if white
civilisation at heart obeyed any different goad.
</p>

<p>
'That's all the music you'll hear,' Dick nodded
his head in the direction of the sound.
</p>

<p>
'Life can be lived without stimulants,' she said.
</p>

<p>
'D'you call it life?'
</p>

<p>
He tried to take her hand.  She moved it.
</p>

<p>
'Norah, you're driving me mad.  Do you want to?'
</p>

<p>
'You know I don't,' she whispered.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you see? ... In a few days, my foot'll
be well, I must go.  Must I go alone, without hope,
knowing I'll never see you again?  I really think
I'll kill myself.'
</p>

<p>
What about Archie?'
</p>

<p>
'Would he kill himself?' asked Dick quietly.
'Would he ... notice even?'
</p>

<p>
She did not answer.
</p>

<p>
'Be fair to him; but be fair to yourself; be
generous to me.'
</p>

<p>
She was silent, listening to the message of the
drums.
</p>

<p>
He interpreted her silence to his wishes, and slid
his hand up her arm.  She did not resist; it seemed
so much simpler to accept the philosophy of the
drum and surrender to the primeval forces.  Dick's
lips were on hers, but his kisses reminded her of her
husband's early love-making.  Without much
conviction, she pushed them away and stood upright,
her breasts heaving.  Dick seized her small hands
as they pushed at his chest, pulling her against him.
His arm went round her body and lifted her to
him till her toes barely touched the ground.  He
smothered her white, upturned face with kisses.  She
could hardly breathe.  For a moment she was tense
and tingling; her senses shot up like firelight, then
narrowed to a pin point.  Heaviness descended on
her and remorse.  Her own voice rang in her
ears&mdash;'What about Archie?'
</p>

<p>
She struggled and he released her.
</p>

<p>
'Go now, Dick,' she said, her deep voice husky,
and picking up the lamp she left him.
</p>

<p>
He waited silent in his chair for hours it seemed;
then, as she made no sign, he rose, swinging his
hurricane lamp.  She watched the light stagger away
across the river with a feeling of utter desolation.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Next morning she sat down at her writing-table.
Outside the window squatted Jacketi waiting
impassively for her letter.
</p>

<p>
Jacketi was a bad lot, he liked beer and women
better and spared truth further than most natives,
but he had perfect manners and wonderful legs.
Sixty miles in thirty hours he would do, and
overtake in a day and a night the three days' stages
of a white man.  For this Norah had summoned
him to carry a letter to Archie.
</p>

<p>
Africa was silent in the daylight and traditions
of loyalty and chastity asserted themselves.  She
resented the struggle and thought cynically how
much simpler it would have been, if Dick had
imposed his will on her: like Montaigne's lady, who,
after a troop of cavalry had been billeted in her
house, wrote in her diary, This night, praise the
Virgin, I am satisfied without sin.'
</p>

<p>
She had decided to call to Archie to come and,
if his presence did not stem the flood which
threatened to sweep her away, at least she would talk
things out aboveboard and honestly with him.
Painfully she drafted a letter: not an easy one
to write.  She tore up her first attempt and scrawled,
'<i>Dear Archie, If you love me, come straight
back.</i>&mdash;NORAH.'  She sealed it and handed it through the
window to the waiting Jacketi.  Then she wrote a
note to Dick, telling him to keep his side of the
river till she sent for him.  Norah never did things
by halves.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
A few days later Jacketi was standing again on
the verandah, tired but smiling.
</p>

<p>
'Well, Jacketi, did you find the Bwana?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, indeed, mistress.'
</p>

<p>
'Did he give you a letter?'
</p>

<p>
'No, indeed, mistress....'
</p>

<p>
'What did the Bwana say?'
</p>

<p>
Jacketi imitated Archie's manner and voice.
</p>

<p>
'"All right, Jacketi."'
</p>

<p>
'Was that all?'
</p>

<p>
Jacketi nodded his head composedly.  She flung
him a shilling.  'You can go now,' and re-entered
the darkened room.
</p>

<p>
Had Archie ignored this appeal too and pushed
forward on his 'cattle business'?  If so ... But
since he was as saving with letters as with words,
he might even now be on his way back to her.  She
must have patience and wait.  He should reach
the farm not later than Wednesday."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ross flung out his arm with a deprecatory gesture.
At least that is how I interpreted the path of his
glowing cigar-end.
</p>

<p>
"Some of the blame," he said, "should you be
old-fashioned enough to think in terms of blame
and praise, must be reserved for Africa.
</p>

<p>
To understand the problem of Norah's ... fall,
bid for self-expression, or whatever your brand of
morality calls it, apply my formula for gauging
what Africa will make of a man:&mdash;'Lowest Common
Failing cubed' if you remember.  Our first task is
the ever congenial one of spotting the L.C.F., the
ruling weakness.  Poor Norah, the field is big
enough.  So big, selection is difficult; for, outside
courage and honesty, she had few noteworthy
virtues.
</p>

<p>
Pride, hot temper&mdash;neither was missing, but
neither ruled her.  Irreverence&mdash;a full share, but
nothing notable for the century.  A free tongue, a
gambler's heart&mdash;I feel we are 'warmer.'  Rebelliousness,
generosity&mdash;which of these two failings to
choose?
</p>

<p>
From her cradle she had been a rebel.  I have
mentioned a few instances&mdash;her expulsion from the
Red Cross, her defiance of the rules of war when
she rescued Archie, and of the rules of common sense
when she married him, her preference of Africa to
Edinburgh, and so on.  To Norah a custom established,
a practice accepted, dared her to its disregard
or breach.  The temptation to break with her sex's
tradition of, at any rate overt, chastity must have
been overwhelming, while to the itch to break
through rules, she could only oppose fidelity to her
promise.
</p>

<p>
Generosity, my second choice, had ever made it
hard for her to say 'no' or to withhold what lay
in her power to give.  As a child she had lavished
her pennies on the utterly undeserving poor.  As
a girl, disregarding the cost, she had always been
at the call of any friend, or stranger for that matter,
in a difficulty.  And now she could by an act, not
in itself uncomfortable, grant Dick a boon he craved,
whose refusal he hinted would make him desperate
... while Archie, it seemed ... did not care.
</p>

<p>
So, if you wish, you may charge her ultimate
surrender to her double weakness exploited by Africa;
if you prefer, to her single strength betrayed by
Archie's silence, that loyalty to her bond long and
savagely honoured.
</p>

<p>
As an English writer you may be trusted not to
impute her fall to mere weakness of the flesh.  You
would never admit that a woman of your nation and
class would take a lover from so disinterested a
motive.  Adultery on grounds of spite, altruism,
jealousy, poverty, revenge, avarice, or even absence
of mind is admissible.  From passion, unthinkable.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Well, the decisive Wednesday came without sign
or rumour of Archie.
</p>

<p>
On Saturday night Dick's lantern a second time
came swinging across the river."

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
That Tanganyika was destined to be alike
villain and setting of the drama which followed,
first sight of the lake gave Norah no warning.
</p>

<p>
The lovers had waited on the farm for Dick's
supplies to come till Norah would stay no longer.
Leaving a letter for Archie, and replenishing Dick's
stores from the reserves on the farm, that the Congo
expedition had already diminished, they started on
the three weeks' ulendo through the bush, Dick on
a bicycle, Norah in her machila.1[<a id="chap0107fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0107fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0107fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0107fn1text">1</a>] A hammock slung on one pole or two and carried between two
or four natives, relieved at intervals.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Lying uncomfortably on her back, she saw little
of the country she was carried through.  Her landscape
was limited by ranks of trees on either side.
Overhead she could stare at the African sky already
banked with rain-clouds.  Or she could lie on her
side and watch the sandy path for hurrying streams
of pre-occupied ants or for occasional spoor, the
only manifestation of the shy life of the forest.
Sometimes her eye would be caught by a bundle
of scarlet flowered mistletoe, the alpine outline of
a great ant heap, a tree curiously deformed, or the
melancholy traces of an almost obliterated garden;
till oppressed by the nearness and insignificance of
these sights, she would shut her eyes and imagine
the evening with Dick, when the camp fire would
gild from below the interlacing boughs.
</p>

<p>
But now the ulendo was nearly done.  For an
hour the road had sloped precipitously from plateau
level lakewards 3000 feet below.  The tip and tilt
of the machila was vertiginous.  Broad leafed, dark
trees obscured the sky: rampant undergrowth and
luxurious herbage hid the ground.  A native
laboured up towards them; he was old and one-eyed.
Her carriers called to him for news of the steamer,
but he only stared.  They were strangers in a strange
land.  The air felt warmer and clammier.  Languid
flies settled heavily on Norah's face and hands.
She expected momentarily to see the lake below her
feet, but the dark trees shut her in.
</p>

<p>
The machila-bearers stopped singing the mournful
'Mai illova,' 'Deep in the Ground,' that was their
favourite carrying song, and started a brisk
marching tune into which the name 'Tanganyika' came
again and again.  The swing of the hammock was
barely tolerable.  She caught the word 'malala' in
the song&mdash;the sleeping sickness, for whose sake men
shun the lake.  They met a second native blind in
one eye&mdash;was all this mutilation man's work or
the lake's?  A single mulombwa tree with bare
boughs and canary yellow flowers stood out by the
roadside, thirty feet high and as straight as a spear.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the steeply tilted machila stopped with
a jerk and shot her on to her feet.
</p>

<p>
Had that travel-stained hammock been Elijah's
fiery chariot it could not have translated her more
suddenly into a new universe.  From the close forest
that had so long confined her body and her mind,
she was caught up into a blue firmament, a world
of misty blue glass over which distant shadows
played.  As she gazed the blue mirror resolved into
sky, mountains, water.  Under heaven, the hills;
under the hills, the lake with its horizon flung far
above her head, above the tree tops.
</p>

<p>
This vision of a new world seemed to hint at the
new life she was entering.  A life of beauty
and&mdash;inevitably&mdash;romance, free from the sordidness of
daily struggle, cleared of the orts of a disastrous
past.  The child understood life as little as she
understood the lake.  Her inherited instinct was to
play for the highest stakes and risk all, without
weighing the cost, on a single throw.  But this
sudden revelation of beauty almost frightened her into
taking thought.  That such loveliness existed seemed
a spur to its pursuit.  Was she treading a path that
led to it?  Almost against her will she strained her
eyes into the future.
</p>

<p>
Since the night that Dick's lantern had crossed
the flats for the second time, she had kept her mind
strapped to the present moment, fiercely contented
in her passion for Dick, refusing regret, denying
foresight.
</p>

<p>
Archie, whose memory her mind, like a tongue
with a sensitive tooth, shunned but could not avoid,
had failed her; Dick had come to the rescue.  Dick
was her slave; Archie was the slave of the farm.
She loved Dick ... she was almost sure.  She
was surer she did not love Archie.
</p>

<p>
What would come of it all?  The preliminaries
she faced with contempt.  Scandalous tongues,
slights to be met, the ostrich-like antics of the Law,
details in the Press (for she realised she would be
good copy and might even run to posters).  She
would pass through this indifferently for what lay
beyond....  If anything lay beyond.  Romance
had fooled her before.  Was Life Repetition and
Cycle?  'The thing that has been, is that which shall
be: and that which is done is that which shall be
done; and there is no new thing under the sun.'
</p>

<p>
She knew Dick's mind no better than the day he
had come to the farm, than the day he had entered
her ward seven years ago.  She did not seem to
penetrate the brilliant skin and glorious plumage.
What lay behind? ... But surely Dick loved her,
and why haggle over the endurance or value of that
love?  Why chill the warmth of the present by
brooding over a future as fathomless as the lake,
whose bottom had never been plumbed?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She left the chattering group of carriers to rejoice
at the sight of their journey's end and sat down
under the mulombwa tree to wait for Dick, who
had found the path too steep and rough for his
bicycle.
</p>

<p>
What Dick was feeling I can only guess.  I had
met him at the beginning of his shooting trip, or
'voyage of exploration,' as he preferred to see it,
dining with the District Commissioner at rail-head.
But that was before he fell into the meshes of
Norah's beauty.
</p>

<p>
She, of course, told me what he said, and did,
and looked like, but a woman's evidence for or
against her lover isn't worth much.
</p>

<p>
Love-making is largely bluff.  To get yourself
taken, you must appear, if not a fine fellow, at
least an interesting one.  (It's true she'll probably
love you for some absurdity you've forgotten to
cover up, but that's not your fault.)  Then,
especially if love's illicit, men and women begin with
different rules.  As different as big game and bird
shooting.
</p>

<p>
Your big game shot and your woman do the
trick by stalking.  They locate the victim, crawl
up, taking cover behind each blade of grass, aim
long and carefully with one eye shut.  Your bird
shot fires with both eyes open, by instinct rather
than aim, before or behind him at birds which
beaters, or circumstances, drive.  Then he waits for
the next covey.  Some men even like pigeon shooting.
</p>

<p>
Dick, I suspect, started with the ideas of the bird
shot.  Since he left the railway, he had hardly seen
a white woman, and he still carried the newcomer's
prejudice against black.  He would be in a susceptible
mood, when he came on Norah that morning
in the forest.  If Joseph had been a month or two
alone in the bush, and if Potiphar's wife had been
in the same street with Norah, Holy Writ would
have been altered.  And, as the Americans say,
Dick's second name wasn't Joseph.  Nor for that
matter was Norah's surname Potiphar.  But
circumstances, the uncongenial life, the errant
husband's absence were all beating for Dick.  His wits,
quick where women were concerned, divined this
and whispered that this loveliness was not
unapproachable.  And in the matter of rushing in, Dick
was never on the side of the angels.
</p>

<p>
It was this idea that so swelled Dick's foot that
he could not move it from the farm.  Constant
intercourse with Norah was not calculated to heal wound
in foot or heart and hourly he fell deeper under her
spell: under the spell, too, of his own manly
eloquence.  His visit the evening before Norah
summoned Archie and called in vain, was undertaken, I
should say, by an impetuous lover, who hoped that
his mistress's interest was not severely platonic.
His repulse added body to his passion since it is the
nature of men only to prize the possession that is
refused them.
</p>

<p>
Norah's absence, during her days of waiting for
Archie, was of the nature that makes the heart grow
fonder.  He saw her continually across the river; in
imagination he felt her lips on his, her body in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
Tantalised by memory and proximity, goaded by
the lust of the unobtainable, his passion had
mastered all inhibitory instinct.  The flood of his
imagination rose and swept majestically over the
weir of the Divorce Courts and breasted even the
subsequent dam of Holy Matrimony.  When I met
him at rail-head, I got the impression that Dick was
not the sort who would find it unpleasant, for
example, to be cited as co-respondent with the
daughter of a peer.  So when in the end Norah consented
to go away with him, the granting of the boon he
craved could have caused him comparatively few
qualms.  He felt, however, more anxiety than
Norah, who had flung her cap with a brave gesture,
and it was with relief that he hailed the lake.
</p>

<p>
'The road lies open,' he cried to Norah.  'The
highway to civilisation.'
</p>

<p>
'It's more like the gateway of Heaven,' she said,
blinded by the beauty before her.
</p>

<p>
'It will be,' he answered.
</p>

<p>
As side by side they descended the path which
turned from rock to sand, the view flattened and
the horizon sank.  The closely grouped thatch of a
native village showed through the trees.  Of white
men and their works no sign.  Throughout their
flight, by avoiding the occasional Bomas and rarer
farms, they had escaped the awkwardness of European
encounter.  Dick commented on their luck.
</p>

<p>
'Anyhow, down here, it's too hot to care,' said
Norah.  She felt already the atmosphere of lake
level&mdash;a matter not only of heightened temperature
and humidity but of changed values.  'High
thermometer and low morals,' was the way she put it.
She felt her remaining scruples dissolve in that mild
air.  Ideas of duty and discipline were left on the
austere highlands, where scattered men scratch a
precarious existence out of a thin soil.  At lake
level, life was no longer an epic of struggle with
victory or defeat as stakes, but a drowsy eclogue
ended by easy oblivion.  The few thousand feet
from the plateau to the lake seemed to bridge all
degrees from Dumfries to Naples, from Calvin to
Priapus.
</p>

<p>
The palm trees threw black shadows on the silver
roofs.  On the soundless air came the laughter of
copper-coloured babies playing in and out of the
lapping water.  Crocodiles and water snakes people
Tanganyika, but in their play the children were as
unconscious of danger as Norah and Dick of the
fate that bore down on them from the lake."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
A couple of afternoons later, Norah's fingers
playing in his hair roused Dick, somnolent
from the heat.
</p>

<p>
'What's wrong with the engines?' she asked.
Dick, who knew nothing of machinery, went through
the motions of intelligent auscultation.
</p>

<p>
'They are banging and clattering worse than
yesterday,' she persisted, with her head on one side;
'hurry, miss a beat, hurry.  And I'm sure we're
going slower.'
</p>

<p>
'The <i>Mimi</i> was never an ocean greyhound,' said
Dick.
</p>

<p>
Now Norah mentioned it, the engines did sound
odd.  Why didn't he know more about the damn
things?  It was monstrous running a British boat
with black officers and crew.  Anything might
happen.  It would be deuced awkward if they broke
down; it might make them ridiculous.  But the odd
noises he thought he noticed might be imaginary.
</p>

<p>
'She'll get us there before she sinks,' he said.
</p>

<p>
Norah pulled his hair a trifle harder.  'Nothing
like an optimist,' she remarked.
</p>

<p>
'It wouldn't be the first time.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean?  Has she sunk before?'
</p>

<p>
'Been sunk.  Before the war she was a deep-sea
boat, carrying Hun officials and mails between
Dar-es-Salaam and Tanga.  One day in 1915 she
ran into a British light cruiser.  The next two years
she spent at the bottom of the Indian Ocean.'
</p>

<p>
'Are you inventing this?' said Norah, taking a
firmer grip on a handful of hair.
</p>

<p>
'Not a word; you can see the shell-marks amidships.'
</p>

<p>
'I love you when you talk nautical, Dick!'
</p>

<p>
Dick dragged her to him and kissed her mocking
lips.
</p>

<p>
'Don't, Dick, you'll distract the man at the wheel.
Go on telling me!  How do you know all this?'
</p>

<p>
'One of the Boma men told me.  Well, eventually
our people raised her, buried the bones of her
captain and crew, and railed her in sections to the
lake.  And here she's the only boat we've got.'
</p>

<p>
'No wonder her engines knock a bit.'
</p>

<p>
'They're good enough engines, I'm told, though
they run red hot.  But they're too big for her hull.
There's a sweepstake among the half-dozen people
who use the lake whether she goes up in flames or
the engines drop through her bottom first.'
</p>

<p>
'Go on, Dick, don't mind me.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I thought you'd like to know,' Dick put
his arm round her shoulders.  'Early this morning
when you were sleeping like a lamb, I was lying
awake watching the metal work going a nice cherry
red, and selecting that flat bit of iron to beat off
the crew from your place in the dinghy when the
ship burst into flames.'
</p>

<p>
Norah laughed.  'You think of everything,' she
said.  'Why don't they put on a new boat?'
</p>

<p>
'Money.'  Dick got up and took a turn aft, where
he could hear the engines more clearly.  He stood
with his head cocked, listening.  At last he shrugged
his shoulders and came back to Norah.
</p>

<p>
'The territory's about bankrupt, and all the cash
there is goes in building a new governor's palace
to impress the noble savage.'
</p>

<p>
He sat down on his bed and fidgeted with the sheet.
</p>

<p>
'I believe you're right,' he said, 'the engines
are about worn out.  They say that at the end of
every trip Alibaba reports to the Railway Workshops
at Kigoma, something like this:&mdash;(he imitated
the genial obsequiousness and urbane gesticulation
of the Arab skipper)&mdash;'Yes, sir, thank you, sir, good
run, sir.  Boilers finish, sir.  Want new one.  No,
sir?  Very good, sir, start Wednesday, sir.'
</p>

<p>
Norah's deep laugh rang out.  Dick's Irish blood
made him a good mimic.  Moreover, life since she
left the farm was one long first day of the holidays,
and anything was good for a laugh.
</p>

<p>
'I adore Alibaba,' she said, 'but I daren't think
what his toilet will be, when he feels he knows us
a little better.'
</p>

<p>
There was some ground for this apprehension.
They had boarded the vessel, scrambling up a rope
from her dinghy on to her dirty iron deck, to be
welcomed by a corpulent, bowing figure clad in a
khaki jacket buttoned up to the chin, new red fez,
vast trousers once white, and patent leather boots.
His pock-marked face had shone as he 'escorted
them to their quarters,' a ceremony which consisted
of kicking the deck clear of cooking utensils, baskets
of meal, firewood, chickens and goats, and helping
Changalilo erect the beds.  But once under way,
Alibaba's habit was to replace the new fez with a
dirty skull cap of broderie anglaise, unbutton his
jacket from top to bottom, unlace his boots largely
and unhitch his trousers till they bellied menacingly.
</p>

<p>
In this negligé he moved slowly between a moribund
Madeira chair, the wheel and the engine-room.
Unlike any other skipper who ever sailed the lake,
he ran night as well as day, feeling his way by some
extra sense for squalls, islands, and rocks.
</p>

<p>
All the work on board was accomplished by him.
If from some sense of fitness, he issued orders which
awakened no answering chord in the crew, it was
with unruffled amiability that he executed them himself.
</p>

<p>
Well might the <i>Mimi</i> be called the Democrat's
Utopia.  Instance the business of dropping anchor.
As the <i>Mimi</i> came inshore, Alibaba would blow
his syren rapturously and rattle through a string
of polyglot orders while the crew listened with a
gratified smile, in complete immobility.  Without
the slightest sign of mortification, Alibaba would
waddle forward and, with a push of his patent
leather boot, propel the tiny anchor into the lake.
A sublime gesture worth pages of philosophic
writing or communist propaganda.
</p>

<p>
'Is his name really Alibaba?' asked Norah, laying
her hand over Dick's well-kept fingers.
</p>

<p>
'I think it's because of the crew,' Dick explained.
'Alibaba and the forty thieves.'
</p>

<p>
'Is he an Arab or what?' Mildly interested, she
liked hearing Dick's voice.
</p>

<p>
'"Or what" about describes him,' he replied.  'I
should say every race on the East Coast took a
hand.  Let's see.  His grandfather would be a
Eurasian stationmaster....'
</p>

<p>
'And his grandmother a Zanzibari dancing girl.'
</p>

<p>
'While his mother was kept by a Greek barman.'
</p>

<p>
'But was unfaithful to him with the Goanese
cook.'
</p>

<p>
They laughed together delightedly.  The engines
seemed to run smoother, and Dick's mind was easier.
If Dick was happy, Norah was happy too.  Was
she not on her honeymoon, the sweeter if stolen?
And after the shuttered years on the farm, how
savoury this foretaste of the busy world of men!
</p>

<p>
Like a demon in a pantomime, the pitch black
head of a fireman popped up through an iron hatch,
hung over the side gleaming with sweat and drank
greedily the brackish water of the lake, flicking it
dexterously with straight fingers into a cavernous
mouth.  Then he began to pass armfuls of short logs
from the firewood stacked on the deck to an invisible
comrade by the boilers.
</p>

<p>
A shutter or door was opened in the bowels of
the ship and a noise of hammering issued.  Hammering
and oaths in an unknown tongue.  A blast of
scorching, oil-saturated air reached Dick.  It was as
concrete as a hot hand laid on his face.
</p>

<p>
'By Jove, the heat must be terrific down there.'
he said, 'it's sufficiently torrid on deck.'
</p>

<p>
It had been cool enough that morning when they
left the fishing village where the oxen had been
embarked.  Dawn had streaked the motionless
water with fragile pink and silver.  The boat rode
so low in the water that Norah's head on her pillow
had been almost level with the lake.  Never before
had she felt so near nature, absorbed into beauty,
trespassing on mystery.
</p>

<p>
Her thoughts had jerked back to Archie.  Poor
lad, how this beauty would have bored him and
how he would have glowered at Dick's rhapsodies....
</p>

<p>
Poor Archie, you couldn't help liking him, even
if you didn't love him.  And she must have done
that once, unimaginable as it now was."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Dead Love," mused Ross, "seems to leave
slighter memory even than its mortal begetters.  If
Archie had died, she would still have remembered
every detail of his body and habits.  But the love he
had once inspired&mdash;that had passed like a last year's
sunrise, leaving at the most a certain sadness for a
glory ephemeral.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She stared over the side.  The steamer was following
a deep-water channel, indiscernible to other
eyes than Alibaba's, winding her way very close to
shore through a screen of densely wooded islets,
black against the pale sky of dawn, the debris of
the crater wall.  Here and there, among many
islands that were merely cliffs crowned with tightly
packed trees, glimpses of enticing coves and silvery
beaches called to the lovers to linger.
</p>

<p>
But, like the comrades of Odysseus, Alibaba
stopped his ears and signed to the tall negro at the
helm whose high cheekbones and white beretta-like
cap lent him a certain episcopal dignity, as he spun
the wheel and steered the vessel out into the lake.
</p>

<p>
What was the use, thought Norah, of letting
her mind dwell on Archie now she had left him for
good.  If she had endured something of the agony
of a Samson pulling down the pillars of the loyalty
that supported her world, she did not mean to look
over her shoulder at the ruins.
</p>

<p>
Norah's thought did not run on subtle lines.  Life
for her fell into watertight compartments.  She had
loved Archie with a whole-hearted romantic passion.
That was over, many months dead and shut away in
its own little coffin.  The succeeding phase of wifely
duty, half kindly, half grudging, was over too and
disposed in its less honoured grave.  Now she stood,
as she thought, on the threshold of a new world, a
reborn Norah with no past to catch her feet."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"When she propounded that illusion," said Ross,
"I really couldn't help laughing.  As if we, prisoners
lying in the dark, blindfolded with every shade of
prejudice, handcuffed with immemorial habits,
fettered by years of education, accidental or
deliberate, chained to almost automatic reactions, could
ever start afresh.  We who don't get a fresh start
in the womb, where too we're the slaves of a past
that drags us along from am&oelig;ba to ape.
</p>

<p>
And that is inside ourselves: the outside world
does not stand aside, hat in hand, to let us start
afresh.
</p>

<p>
Still Norah was perhaps freer than some of us.
She felt no moral qualms.  The seventh&mdash;is
it?&mdash;commandment to her had always seemed an
over-rated affair, a question to be solved more by
fastidiousness than morality.  She had always assumed
the right to please herself.  And now she was well
pleased.  Dick was the ideal lover&mdash;happy, charming,
attentive.  She had found the mate Nature had
created for her&mdash;lion-hearted and debonair, the
match for any emergency life might produce, ready
for any risk, game for battle with the gods, who,
when at last she had yielded to his entreaties, had
shouted with Troilus that he would 'throw his glove
to Death himself.'
</p>

<p>
Yes, she had chosen well this time.  All idols
hadn't feet of clay, some surely were pure gold.
The old and disillusioned could not be right.  She
turned from that distasteful theory to the beauty of
the lake.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the islands and the shore receded, the formation
of the 800-mile-long crater revealed itself.
</p>

<p>
Outside towered a circle of hyacinthine blue from
whose summit perhaps at a time before there were
men to suffer, the great cone had been hurled, leaving
a lip here straight as a sword, here jagged as a
jaw of shattered teeth.  Inwards from the torn sides
of the stupendous bowl radiated, like fingers from a
monstrous hand, hills, in these days thick with trees,
dimpled with valleys.
</p>

<p>
These spurs or buttresses gave on to the lake
sometimes in a cliff or tumble of boulders, sometimes
in a sloping facet like the hip of a slate roof.
Down the valleys between them swift streams
hurried or, failing to find a bed, fell in cascades
down thousands of feet.  In spite of the beauty
Norah shivered.
</p>

<p>
'Don't you feel like a mouse in a bucket?' she
said.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As the sun rose higher and hotter, the irregularity
of the engines became more marked&mdash;in Alibaba's
words, 'worse as before, sir.'  Dick's features had
drawn into a frown which even Norah could not
lighten and irritably he paced the narrow deck.
</p>

<p>
Noon was announced by an access of activity
among the deck hands, who bestirred themselves
to eat their thick pink porridge of cooked millet,
dipping fingers into the common bowl.  They were
a chattering, good-humoured crowd, clad in the
remains of blue serge with white beretta-shaped caps
on their shiny black heads.
</p>

<p>
Changalilo became visible threading his way
through them with a plate of soup in each hand.
With lunch he brought a tale of violence and
interference on the part of the lean Indian passenger.
A rambling story, like all native plaints, it was,
starting from the moment of reaching the <i>Mimi</i>
and leading from borrowed pans and stolen cutlery
to high words that ended in a blow.
</p>

<p>
Dick's nerves had been set on edge by the heat
and by anxiety over the engines.  He would not
listen to advice to follow Gallio.  He had always
hated, he said, the Indians in Africa, low-caste
pedlars battening on the ignorant native, and he
wasn't going to stand for any interference with his
servants.  He strode angrily down the hot iron deck,
his white coat flapping.  The deck hands followed
in a curious mob.
</p>

<p>
Norah heard his voice raised in the stern, angry
and a little shrill.
</p>

<p>
'I found the brute squatting half naked on his
hatch,' he reported later, 'eating rice and spilling
it into his beard.  I asked him if he understood
English, and he bowed in a condescending sort of
way.  That made me lose my temper a bit and I
told him if he didn't leave our boys alone, I'd
pitch him into the lake.  The swine didn't stir a
muscle except to smile.  A nasty quiet sort of smile.
It made me wild to see him sitting there, cross-legged
and grinning, as if he'd bought the ship, and I
told him to get up when a white man spoke to him.
Again he didn't move, but went on picking some
grains of rice out of his beard.  He even had the
cheek to close his eyes as if he were tired.
</p>

<p>
'That was a trifle too much, and I took him by
the scruff, lifting him none too gently on to his
feet.  I was going to give him a good cuffing, but
he slid out of my hand like a snake, and disappeared
behind the galley.  By his face as he went,
I shouldn't say he was exactly brimming over with
brotherly love....  I'd have followed him, but
it wouldn't have looked dignified.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm jolly glad you didn't,' said Norah.  'He
might have stuck a knife into you.  Do be careful,
Dick.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd like to see him try,' said Dick, 'but pluck's
not his strong suit ... the odd thing was the way
the crew seemed to side with him.  Usually the
nigger hates the Hindoo, but these blighters looked
upset when I went for the swine.'
</p>

<p>
Dick was a bit upset himself.  No one cares to
feel he has played a poorish part.  It needed all
Norah's admiration to restore his equanimity, and
the physical contact of her cool white hand.
</p>

<p>
If Norah's hand was cool, it was the only thing
on board the boat in that condition.  For, as the
day wore on, the heat of the failing engines, added
to the blaze of the sun, was intolerable.  The sickly
smell of hot oil filled the nostrils; the dazzle off
the water scorched the eyeballs.  Mirage with a
magician's wand lifted island and headland off the
horizon as the lake took a colour of deepest emerald,
its surface networked irregularly with violet
shadows.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
About three in the afternoon, the engines gave a
final jerk and fetched up soundless.  The Chief&mdash;and
only&mdash;Engineer emerged for emphatic converse
with Alibaba.
</p>

<p>
He was an obese Indian with a naturally depressed
air and an easy flow of perspiration.  His
hair and drooping moustaches were grey.  I fancy
a day or two in the engine-room of the <i>Mimi</i> would
send Ph&oelig;bus Apollo a bit grey.
</p>

<p>
Skipper and engineer disappeared, but the sounds
of hammering between decks indicated their continued
existence.  After half an hour they emerged,
dirtier than ever and swimming in sweat.  Dick, now
thoroughly uneasy, thought the time for direct
action had arrived, and joined the party.  Norah,
watching from the bows, guessed from the bowing,
shrugging, and upturned palms that the situation
was not satisfactory.  She was right.
</p>

<p>
'I can't understand engine-room shop in a mixture
of Swahili and Hindustani,' confided Dick, 'but I
gather from Alibaba it's case of "that engine no
good, sir," and "big rod he very sick, sir, he wantee
for die."'
</p>

<p>
'I suppose we'll have to make for the nearest
White Fathers,' said Norah, 'though I do feel an
adulterous couple a bit "de trop" at a mission.'
</p>

<p>
'Alibaba says there isn't a mission anywhere for
100 miles either way up or down this side of the
lake.'
</p>

<p>
'Can't we do that slowly?'
</p>

<p>
'He says not.'
</p>

<p>
'What about crossing over to the other side?'
</p>

<p>
'That's forty miles or so from here, and the
engines are good for another ten at the most.  No,
what they want is to put into a little bay just out
of sight round that headland, where there's good
anchorage for the night.'
</p>

<p>
'I suppose there'll be a village where we can get
food,' said Norah.
</p>

<p>
'In any case,' added Dick, 'there's really no choice.
We can do ten miles at the most.  I'd better tell
them to get on with it.'
</p>

<p>
Much firewood was shot into the furnace and
much steam hissed out into the air, before the engines
clanked regretfully into life.  Alibaba took his place
at the wheel, and, dragging like a wounded buck
that has outdistanced the hunter, the <i>Mimi</i> drew
inshore.  Across her bows loomed a rocky promontory
that dropped in sheer cliff to the water.  Alibaba
swung her wide to miss the piled boulders, which
had crumbled from its face to form a breakwater to
the bay and a council chamber for the grave, black,
diving birds who, bolt upright, stretched their necks
in the sun.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The view that was revealed as the steamer heeled
slowly round the bar and the divers with raucous
cries flapped heavily into the air, presented an
appearance of habitation that momentarily relieved
the wayfarers.
</p>

<p>
At the feet of the densely wooded hills that sloped
from the sheer cliffs of the encircling mountains, a
square red brick tower proclaimed the constructive
instinct of white men.  Its style revealed the faith
of the Catholic Fathers, who, since the days of the
slave trade, have proselytised the lake shores.
</p>

<p>
Help seemed at hand, though the travellers' relief
was marred by the falsehood of their position.
Then, as the steamer drew painfully abreast of the
tower, they recognised the handicraft of a Presence
alike indifferent to hopes of human aid and feelings
of delicacy.  The assurance of Alibaba that
'missionary he finish die long time' was not required
to identify the technique of death and desolation.
</p>

<p>
The windows of the tower gaped blankly, the
round Spanish tiles were broken or missing, trees
and creepers had obliterated all trace of the dwelling
of kindly men.  Not even the squalor of a native
village struggled with the silent supremacy of
nature.  The ruined church tower stood alone to
establish a passing triumph of faith.  Other buildings
that may have once existed had failed to resist
the pressure of the forest.  Even in the bright
sunshine, Norah felt the wing of tragedy over the
deserted station, and she wished Alibaba endowed
with enough imagination to have avoided this
haunted valley for their night's sojourn.
</p>

<p>
But that astute seafarer had not, as it proved,
underrated the endurance of his engines.  Already
panting had degenerated into hiccoughing.  Slower
and slower the <i>Mimi</i> trailed her wounded way
towards the land, heading for the northern arm of
the bay, where a swift little river pouring yellow
into the lake promised anchorage inshore.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When she was within a hundred yards of its
mouth, the end came.  The engines raced
ear-shatteringly.  A grinding noise succeeded, and a
cloud of steam masking the hurrying black forms
of the firemen.  Then a dead silence and the <i>Mimi</i>
rolled lifelessly lakewards, carried out by the yellow
current."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0109"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX
</h3>

<p>
The hour that followed the rattle of the
anchor chain stamped on Norah's brain the
impression of a flood of talk, whose waves broke
over her head.
</p>

<p>
Her eyes were on Dick, white clad, tall and
elegant, in the centre of a sooty group, whose rags
dripped with sweat and whose hands waved in wild
gesticulation.  Her ears were assailed by the clamour
raised by captain and engineer, stokers and crew,
gabbling in a dozen tongues explanations of what
had happened, conjectures of what might have
happened, prophecies of what would happen, while into
the babble cut Dick's sharp queries and criticism.
Advice, questions, protests, orders, oaths, exhortation
rolled in a stream as muddy as the water of the
yellow river.  Only the sinister figure of the lean
Indian passenger kept aloof and silent, contemptuous
of past and future alike.
</p>

<p>
At length the obese engineer detached himself
from the agitated mob and vanished below.
Reappearing unexpectedly through a hatch, he held out
to Dick an armful of warm, distorted metal with
the air of an afflicted father submitting to a doctor
the corpse of his first-born.
</p>

<p>
The interruption had the effect of dispersing the
conference.  Still plying him with questions, Dick
led Alibaba aft.  Norah, who had little confidence
in male brains unassisted, joined them.
</p>

<p>
As she listened, certain facts emerged.  If not
dangerous, the situation was at least unpleasant.
There seemed no doubt that the <i>Mimi</i> was immobile.
Alibaba supported the engineer in insisting that the
engines (connecting rod, was it?) were damaged
beyond his power of repair.
</p>

<p>
'I said it was monstrous,' remarked Dick.  'Only
niggers to run the ship.'  He turned to the Arab.
'Why can't you patch them up?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
Alibaba spread his hands and gabbled apologetically.
Norah gathered from the polyglot flow that
welding or brazing was necessary, and the bellows
of the boat's portable forge were under repair at
Kigoma.  In any case the job was too big for the
<i>Mimi's</i> resources.
</p>

<p>
'Well, what do you mean to do about it?' asked
Dick sourly.
</p>

<p>
Alibaba was silent.  He foresaw that the solution
he eventually proposed would be ill-received.  They
must stay where they were till the ship could be
towed into Kigoma, 300 miles away.
</p>

<p>
The fellow's a fool,' said Dick.  'He doesn't
know his job!  Why not rig a sail, man?'
</p>

<p>
Without replying Alibaba licked his finger and
held it above his head.  Mildly he remarked that
the dead calm would hold till the rains broke.  It
might be weeks.
</p>

<p>
With much head-shaking he rejected a suggestion
of Norah's, opining that an attempt to tow the
steamer behind her dinghy would end after an hour
in mutiny.  'Black fellow he say "too much work no
good"' was his comment.
</p>

<p>
A second fact had to be faced.  Not only was the
vessel stranded, but no rescue could be expected from
Kigoma or elsewhere for many days.  The <i>Mimi</i> was
not due at Kigoma for forty hours, and a further
delay of two or three days would not be sufficiently
unusual to excite attention.  When she was a week
overdue, alarm would be felt.  But even so, there
was no British boat on the lake to send.  Kigoma
would have to get in touch with Albertville across
the water and ask the loan of one of the three
Belgian steamers.  If the Belgians were willing and
a boat was available, she would have to cross the
lake and make slow progress close inshore, visiting
each bay and natural harbour, until she caught sight
of the derelict.
</p>

<p>
Alibaba's estimate that relief could not be
expected for at least twelve days did not strike Norah
as pessimistic.
</p>

<p>
'This'll learn me,' said Dick, 'to trespass into the
Stone Age!'  He stared disconsolately across the
blue water.  A thought struck him: 'What about a
dhow?  Surely there are Arab dhows on the lake?'
</p>

<p>
Again Alibaba shook his head with the deprecatory
tolerance of an Anglican divine.  Before the
English took the land from the Gerimani[<a id="chap0109fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0109fn1">1</a>] there had
been much trade, and fleets of dhows.  But now
... in any case the calm before the rains would
keep dhows beached in their harbours.  And why
should a dhow visit this deserted bay?

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Norah, who did not share Dick's depression and
at first looked on the breakdown as an exciting
adventure, cast her eyes to the land, from which,
it seemed, must come their help.  Would it not be
easy to despatch one of the crew to the nearest
village bidding them send a runner to the first white
settlement with news of the plight of the <i>Mimi</i> and
her passengers?
</p>

<p>
There were no villages, said Alibaba reluctantly,
no natives, no settlements.  Sleeping sickness had
wiped the coast clear of life.  In the old days smoke
from the fires of fishing villages had shown blue on
the shore, but at present...  He waved his hand
in the direction of the ruined tower, and Norah felt
she understood something of that tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Silence fell on the little group.  It testified to
the rugged nature of the country that no one
suggested a march inland or along the shore.  As if
painted on the back-cloth of a stage, before their
faces rose the encircling wall of the dead volcano.
Sheer cliffs that any advance inland must scale.  The
broken formation, which Norah had noticed from
the lake, of spurs and buttresses, that radiated
inwards from the crater sides, interset with mountain
torrents and precipitous valleys, made progress
parallel to the lake almost impossible.  Should the
castaways be bold enough to attempt either of these
desperate marches, braving the risk of sleeping
sickness, where could they find carriers for their
loads&mdash;tents, cooking pots, ammunition, and food?
</p>

<p>
'The mouse has indeed fallen into the bucket,'
thought Norah, as she walked forward with Dick.
Alibaba, crestfallen at the failure of his charge,
offering no cure but patience, retired in silence to
the engine-room.
</p>

<p>
Dick dropped heavily on to his bed.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he said at last, 'it looks like staying here
a fortnight till we're rescued by a crowd of grinning
Bulamatadi.'[<a id="chap0109fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0109fn2">2</a>]

[<a href="#chap0109fn2text">2</a>] Belgians.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'A fortnight will soon be over,' said Norah cheerfully.
But she felt a shadow had fallen between her
and the sun.  In a fortnight she had hoped to be on
the high seas, steaming towards Europe.  It did not
seem so easy to escape from Africa.
</p>

<p>
Dick did not answer, misfortune had pricked his
buoyancy.
</p>

<p>
'It's lucky we have got the oxen on board,' she
went on.  'We've only two days' food in the boxes,
and I don't want you to go shooting with S.S.[<a id="chap0109fn3text"></a><a href="#chap0109fn3">3</a>]
about...'

[<a href="#chap0109fn3text">3</a>] Sleeping sickness.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
She caught her breath in the middle of the
sentence.
</p>

<p>
'Dick,' she cried.  'What idiots we are!'  He did
not look up.  'Dick, how far is it across the lake to
the other side?'
</p>

<p>
'Forty or fifty miles,' he replied gloomily.  'We
can't move a foot.'
</p>

<p>
'No, but the dinghy can!'
</p>

<p>
'What d'you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'With four oars we'd do it between dawn and
dark!  Or nearly.'
</p>

<p>
'What's the good?'
</p>

<p>
'You're not your brightest, dear...  At the
worst we'd be on the route of the Belgian boats.
At the best we'd strike a Belgian Boma or mission.'
</p>

<p>
Dick's gloom was dispelled, and he hurried aft to
requisition the skipper's knowledge of the lake.  In
answer to his shouts Alibaba emerged from the secret
places of the ship.  His smiling face signalled to
Norah that her plan was passed.  Even the lean
Indian was interested.  She wondered if he had at
first been drugged with hemp and the effects had
now worn off....  What an interminable amount
of talk between Dick and the skipper!  How men
did talk!
</p>

<p>
'We start at dawn!'  Dick greeted her at last.
'It'll be a long day, let's go and stretch our legs
ashore.'
</p>

<p>
'Don't be maddening, Dick!  Start at the
beginning!'
</p>

<p>
The reaction from anxiety had been too much for
Dick's self-control.  He was bubbling over with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry, darling.'  He kissed her on the cheek.
'Well, Alibaba says there's a Belgian poste, which is
Bulamatadi for Boma, opposite here and about
twenty miles north.  The lake is under forty miles
across here, so we'll be over to-morrow night and
drinking beer with the Chef du Poste the next day.
A happy issue to all our afflictions, what?'  Dick's
spirits easily went up or down, and he rattled on.
'Alibaba is picking four of the best oars among the
thieves, and there'll be just room for Changalilo and
the baggage.  We'd better take a goat, too.  He'll
do as a mascot, if we don't have to eat him.'
</p>

<p>
'What about the others?' asked Norah, who had
not Dick's happy absorption in self.
</p>

<p>
'What about them?' he stared at her for a moment,
'why they'll be all right.  They'll stay here
till we get word through to Kigoma.'
</p>

<p>
Leg-stretching ashore ended in sleeping there.
Norah was reluctant to leave the ship, but Dick's
enthusiasm swept her objections aside.
</p>

<p>
'It's safe enough if we're careful,' he said.  'The
"palp"[<a id="chap0109fn4text"></a><a href="#chap0109fn4">4</a>] never goes far from water and shade.'  He
pointed to a strip of bare rocky ground that lay at
the back of the amphitheatre of the bay.  Above it
rose a sheer red cliff.  For a quarter of a mile there
was neither water nor tree.  'At night,' he continued,
'out there there's no fear of fly.  Here there's the
certainty of a stench of oil and crew.  Not to
mention the roll.  Besides, I want to repack my kit.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0109fn4"></a>
[<a href="#chap0109fn4text">4</a>] Glossina palpalis&mdash;the sleeping sickness fly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Changalilo quickly loaded the baggage into the
dinghy, leaving, at Dick's instructions, the heavy
ammunition chest on board to cross intact next day.
The loaded magazine of Dick's Mauser was enough
for emergencies on shore.
</p>

<p>
There was some difficulty in finding oarsmen.
The crew had settled down to a gamble on the forecastle,
slapping on the deck the dice made of cowrie
shells filed smooth on one side, and betting which
way they would turn.
</p>

<p>
When at last the boat was ready to start, Norah
remembered the oxen.  Even if their fate was
slaughter, till the day arrived their life would be
more endurable on shore, where the hands could
build a lion-proof kraal.
</p>

<p>
'Can we manage them?' said Dick.  He was unwilling
to incur the extra work till the skipper's opposition
to Norah's plan&mdash;from laziness, he thought&mdash;converted
him, and, on the principle of 'worst
first,' the ox, who had nearly pitched Dick into the
hold the evening before, was lowered into the water.
</p>

<p>
They had paddled the greater part of the quarter
mile that separated the steamer from the shore,
when Obadiah the ox, as Dick had christened him,
suddenly varied the puffing and snorting with which
he met each wavelet, by a plunge that threw his
quarters out of the water, and a bellow in which
Norah, accustomed to cattle, could read an agony
of fear and pain.  He lashed out, plunging and
rearing.  His forelegs churned the water to bubbles
that were dark with sand scooped from the bottom.
His maddened struggles rocked the heavily laden
boat.
</p>

<p>
'Look out, Changalilo; he'll have us over!'
shouted Norah.
</p>

<p>
The frenzied beast, released by Changalilo, slipped
rapidly astern, as if drawn by a current.  As he
passed her, Norah was moved by the agonised appeal
in his mild eyes.  A stain more sinister than sand
now darkened the water.  She looked at the deck
hands and saw that they were resting on their oars,
pointing with widely grinning mouths at the
contortions of the ox.  Bellow on bellow filled the air.
</p>

<p>
'What on earth is it, Changalilo?' she asked.
Then as his lips framed the world 'ngwene,' she
understood.  'A crocodile's got him?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' shouted Dick, 'look!' and she saw a black
tail flick out of the water.
</p>

<p>
'Poor brute,' she sighed, and turned her eyes away.
</p>

<p>
The struggle receded from the amused view of
the oarsmen, as the crocodile relentlessly drew his
victim towards the southern arm of the bay.  There
was no hurry; he had a good hold on a hind leg
and in twenty minutes or so the ox would be drowned
and wedged on a certain muddy bank, where the
swollen corpse could rot the time required to make
it palatable.
</p>

<p>
In the distance the agony continued, now a fore-leg
showing above the surface, now the wide horns,
now the white belly.
</p>

<p>
'Do make them row in, Dick,' said Norah.  'It's
horrible!'
</p>

<p>
Reluctantly they paddled the dinghy inshore.
As the bows grated on the shingle an apparent log
lying near the edge of the yellow river rose to its
feet and disappeared into the safety of the stream.
</p>

<p>
The momentary glimpse of the rough scales dried
khaki-grey in the sun, the pale wicked eye, the
high hind legs, which sloped the obscene body at a
slinking angle down to the crooked forelegs, recalled
the monstrous saurians of the prehistoric past.
</p>

<p>
'And, by Jove, there's another!' whispered Dick,
nodding his head at a couple of black knobs on
the surface of the water, that represented the snout
and eyebrow of a submerged monster.  He reached
for his gun and fired.  A long, pale belly cartwheeled
into the air with slashing tail and legs, to
sink without a sound and be devoured, perhaps still
living, by its mate.
</p>

<p>
Camp was pitched in silence on the site already
chosen by Dick, and the deck hands were sent off
grumbling to collect firewood.  Norah was oppressed
by the desolation of the bay, once the scene of
hopeful and devoted enterprise, now delivered over to
reptiles.  A curse seemed to rest there, and she
wondered whether by passing a night on these shores
she submitted to its power.
</p>

<p>
Here the pale Galilean had not conquered.  The
gods of Africa had shown they still could wield
their old weapons of remorseless disease, sudden
death, and instantaneous decay, installing at the end
a garrison of reptiles, cruel and hideous like
themselves, the survivors of more ancient and horrific
epochs."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I don't mean," said Ross, "that Norah, who was
a healthy-minded little thing, really believed such
stuff.  She was upset by the pitiful fate of the ox
under her impotent eyes, and felt a distinct, if
unreasonable, dislike for the place.
</p>

<p>
She was tempted to ask Dick to take her back to
the steamer.  But as the wish crossed her mind, she
heard the report of his gun up the beach.  He was
amusing himself, bless his heart.  She knew men did
not welcome feminine intuitions that make them
alter their plans, and thrust the impulse aside as
cowardly.
</p>

<p>
But when she recollected that rapturous first sight
of Tanganyika, and the hopes it had raised of quick
release from the forest's encirclement and of an
easy passage along azure waters to the civilisation
her heart desired, disillusionment was keen.  Would
she ever be free, or had Africa put out a tentacle
that had retaken her to its dark bosom?  Would
Africa master her as it had mastered this ruined
mission?"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ross rose and stretched his arms above his head.
He lit a match to see his watch.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The work of white men's hands," he remarked,
"does not seem to prosper on the shores of the lake.
Ujiji, for instance, is smaller to-day than it was
in Livingstone's time; Niamkolo is a mound of
bricks hidden in the grass; Kigoma, since we took
it, grows smaller every year....
</p>

<p>
The history of the ruined tower that filled Norah
with such foreboding, I never heard.  Whatever
the doom, it fell before my day.  Still, it is not hard
to imagine the birth and death of the station.  Think
of the arrival of the French Fathers....
</p>

<p>
With heavy rosaries hanging below their untrimmed
beards, wide hats on their heads, clad in
white robes of coarse cloth, they had sailed from
some elder station on the lake into the unknown.
</p>

<p>
Think of the start of their voyage in a home-made
boat of clumsy lines, whose unpainted white
wood planks showed the roughly-nailed joints.
Overhead on a light framework was stretched an
awning to shield them from the sun of indefinite
days.
</p>

<p>
The Father who built the boat came with them
to the edge of the water, a carpenter's apron over
his white robe, and stood shading his eyes beside
the little red fire on which he had warmed the pitch
to give the seams a final caulking.  The other
Fathers stood in a group under the mango trees at
the top of the shallow brick steps that led to the
lake, silently speculating on the fate of their brothers
whom they might, or might not, see again.
</p>

<p>
For many days the adventurers were rowed by
native Christians to the singing of Catholic hymns
learnt in place of the melancholy water songs of
their ancestors.  At last the canoe stopped at a
fishing village that once populated the bay.
</p>

<p>
Long beards and robes won for the Fathers the
respect due to wizards.  Moreover, there would be
hope of their help against the Arab slavers, who
at that time led a train of bones and blood across
Africa, whose dhows were familiar in passage
up-lake to Ujiji, whence they drove their wares
overland to Bagamayo for shipment to the markets of
Zanzibar.  Had starvation and hardship unduly
reduced their cargo, the loss was soon made good
from the lake villages.
</p>

<p>
In return for protection from this menace, the
villagers would be willing to build a church.  They
were simple folk and glad to help those who seemed
kind and good men.
</p>

<p>
So, as the seasons succeeded each other, a group
of buildings sprang up on the lake shore.  The
layout would be like that of the other lake missions.
A monastery would spread its length ..."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Ross," I interrupted, "have you ever read a book
called <i>Sandford and Merton</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Ross.  "Is it interesting?"
</p>

<p>
"Interesting?" I replied.  "Hardly interesting...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The monastery," continued Ross placidly,
"would spread its single&mdash;or double-storied&mdash;length
parallel to the lie of the lake.  The roof would be
low-pitched with a wide overhang supported on
brick pillars, to form a dark spacious verandah from
whose centre a double flight of steps descended to
the courtyard.  At right angles on one wing lay
stores and outbuildings; and on the other stood
the church with narrow unglazed windows, round
brick columns, scanty fittings, and the ornaments
of Latin Catholicism, when humble so devotional, so
secular when rich.
</p>

<p>
Gardens were dug, fruit trees planted, crops
cultivated.  All the time proceeded the less material
work of tending the sick, teaching and preaching.
Permanganate of potassium and epsom salts,
sermons and hymns, reading, writing and the other
queer things they teach the heathen&mdash;Christian
philosophy and the geography of the Holy Land.
</p>

<p>
By how much the black man profited, I shouldn't
care to say, but I don't doubt that the community
grew and multiplied.  The birth-rate increased;
famines were averted; refugee relatives from raided
villages came in, and the blessings of the first
chapter of Genesis seemed to rest on the devoted
labours of the Fathers, until ...
</p>

<p>
The first 'fly' may have been brought by one of
the refugees or carried by game or spread naturally
up the lakeshore.  At the beginning the presence
of the destroyer would not be suspected.  The
increased death-rate would be attributed to an
unhealthy summer; the wasting of the sufferers to
fever; their fits to epilepsy; their madness to
insanity.
</p>

<p>
But as the buryings increased, the fear of an
epidemic must have gripped the hearts of the
Fathers.  Their slight medical knowledge was as
unavailing as their prayers.  Bells will have sounded,
masses been said, and litanies sung for defence from
the arrow that flieth in darkness and the pestilence
that destroyeth at noonday.  But the mortality did
not stay.
</p>

<p>
Finding the new God did not help them, some
of the people will have relapsed into heathendom.
At first frightened, they would settle into a mute
endurance, nearer apathy than stoicism.  The more
energetic would flee from the doomed villages ... and
spread the sickness with them.  The rest awaited
the end with fatalism.
</p>

<p>
One by one the Fathers buried their people,
mourning the loss now of some favourite convert,
now of some skilful workman.
</p>

<p>
Whether the sickness ultimately struck all the
white men, or whether, since they could not help,
they took the resolution of abandoning the stricken
settlement and their lives' work, one does not know.
Alibaba's words, a later discovery of Norah's, and
the French Fathers' tradition of self-sacrifice, suggest
that death found them at their work.  The end was
the same in either case: Africa took back its own,
and the insatiable forest swallowed up villages,
buildings, and every sign of life, as relentlessly as it
had always engulfed every trace of human endeavour."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I interrupted the silence that followed Ross' last
words with a hint that the fate of the abandoned
mission hardly touched on the story of Norah and
Dick.
</p>

<p>
"So you think," said Ross, "that no emanation
from the tragedies of the past lingers over their
scene.  I cannot bring myself to believe that the
strip of land from Dixmude to the Vosges will ever
quite lose the breath of four years' agony and
heroism; though I know there is a view that those
years may now be forgotten.  However, I am
telling this story and you must allow me to suggest
that the wind of that elder tragedy still ruffled the
beauty of the bay, blowing cold on Norah's heart.
But since, however, you prefer strictly material
facts, I will skip her presentiments, simply mentioning
that they were interrupted by the reappearance
of the two deck hands, who had collected, they
considered, sufficient wood.
</p>

<p>
As Norah watched the dinghy, rowed towards
the steamer's masthead light, recede from the now
darkened shore, a great sense of loneliness filled
her&mdash;that microscopic feeling engendered, for instance,
by an imprudent glance at the stars.
</p>

<p>
It was succeeded by more practical apprehension.
</p>

<p>
'I wonder if we should have kept them,' she
thought.  'What would happen to us if the
boat...'"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0110"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X
</h3>

<p>
Norah woke before it was light.  She made
no attempt to recapture a sleep that dreams
had disturbed&mdash;dreams in which the ox was drowned
again, in which a crocodile pursued her leaden steps
while the Indian's crooked knife held Dick from her
rescue.  As soon as her watch showed half-past four,
she summoned Changalilo from the fire which he
had tended through the night, waking at intervals
as a native will.  Yesterday it had been decided to
strike camp before dawn, giving him time to cook
breakfast and carry their loads down to the shore
ready to start at the first gleam of light.
</p>

<p>
Breakfast finished, Dick led the way to the beach.
When they were twenty yards away, they heard
a quick scrunch on the shingle and a quiet plop in
the water.
</p>

<p>
'Ngwene,' said Changalilo casually, and kept
back from the lake's edge, where the crocodile they
had disturbed still might lurk.
</p>

<p>
They waited, Norah's hand in Dick's.  The water
was warmer than the air, and a mist hung on its
surface.  Above the mist the mountains across the
lake were already outlined against a faint sky.
</p>

<p>
Voices on the <i>Mimi</i>, carried by the water, were
audible.
</p>

<p>
'Damn Alibaba!' said Dick.  'Why can't he send
the boat?'
</p>

<p>
Norah felt her last night's uneasiness return.
'But it's early yet,' she said.
</p>

<p>
The talking on board continued.  Alibaba's voice
was recognisable, raised in command or protest.
</p>

<p>
'He's having a job getting the boat's crew out,'
said Dick, in answer to an unspoken anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Dawn came suddenly, and the water showed a
delicate misty blue, as if it were seen through
silvered crystal.  Dick raised his voice in a hail.
The sounds on the steamer ceased.  She was visible
now, squat and black on the water, but the distance
was too great to distinguish figures in the group that
darkened the deck.
</p>

<p>
Dick hailed again.
</p>

<p>
A silence seemed to brood on the face of the
waters till the banal reassurance 'All right' floated
to them on the motionless air.
</p>

<p>
'That wasn't Alibaba?' asked Norah.
</p>

<p>
Dick shrugged his shoulders in nervous irritation.
He was angry with Alibaba, angry with himself.
</p>

<p>
Soon, however, the sight of black figures climbing
over the stern dispelled his apprehension.  'That's
better,' he sighed, 'but why five of them?  We
don't want more than four oars.'
</p>

<p>
As the boat approached, Norah noticed that for
the long row its crew had discarded the unfamiliar
European oar, reverting to the pointed paddle of
their fathers.  This looked like business.  She took
a last glance at the shore, where she had sensed such
sinister influence, and smiled at her unfulfilled
forebodings.
</p>

<p>
What the devil's that blasted Hindoo doing in
the boat?' cried Dick suddenly.
</p>

<p>
Norah looked and saw the Indian's sardonic
features momentarily revealed over the rising and
falling shoulder of the bow-paddler, an ape-like
negro, whose hunting knife, stuck in his belt, lent
a piratical air to a personality no doubt genial
enough.
</p>

<p>
'I'll jolly soon have him out of that,' muttered
Dick.
</p>

<p>
As if his intentions had been divined, the uplifted
paddles were checked and the silver water dripped
from their narrow blades.  The boat swung
broadside on, a stone's-throw from land, rocking
gently.  Norah was near enough to see the
perturbed, uneasy features of the crew that contrasted
with the ironic composure of the Indian.  He rose
slowly to his feet from his seat in the stern.  His
thin lips twisted into a smile.  His beaklike nose and
the naked, withered skin of his neck reminded Norah
of a vulture that had settled on a buck she had shot
on the farm.
</p>

<p>
He stood for a moment in silence, smiling at the
Europeans.
</p>

<p>
'Yesterday,' he began nasally, 'the Sahib struck
this slave for remaining seated in the Sahib's
presence.  The slave now stands.'
</p>

<p>
'Cut that out,' shouted Dick, 'and paddle the boat
inland at once.'
</p>

<p>
The habit of obeying white men stimulated the
gorilla-like stoker to dip his paddle in the water,
but the Indian stopped him with a gesture.
</p>

<p>
'Surely, Sahib, when my words are ended, we
will paddle to land.'
</p>

<p>
His hand, waved gently towards the Belgian
coast, explained his meaning.
</p>

<p>
'Yesterday the Sahib forbade his slave to interfere
in his affairs.  He will now lay the lake between
himself and those affairs.'
</p>

<p>
He threw back his head and laughed noiselessly.
Dick went red with rage.
</p>

<p>
'The damned nigger...' he cried.
</p>

<p>
Under her breath Norah whispered to him to
take his gun.
</p>

<p>
'It's him or us,' she said.
</p>

<p>
'Do you mean?...' began Dick, then broke off.
'Hell!' he shouted.  Why did I waste those
cartridges yesterday?'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;&mdash;' began Norah.
</p>

<p>
'I emptied my magazine on a croc last night,'
he confessed.  'I thought I had another handful in
my shooting jacket.'
</p>

<p>
'Then bluff him with the empty gun.  If you can
frighten the Indian, the natives will turn.'
</p>

<p>
But if Dick was a bluffer, his was not the brand
that pulls off forlorn hopes.  His belief in the
avarice of the Indians who colonise Africa suggested
an easier plan.  Holding out his purse, he shouted
promises of lavish reward, if the Indian would take
them off.
</p>

<p>
The offer made to the crew might have had effect.
Their simple minds were free from hostility or
mistrust.  But in the dominant heart of the Hindoo,
vengeance, and doubt that promises would be
honoured, displaced cupidity.
</p>

<p>
He gave the order to paddle.
</p>

<p>
Too late Dick ran to the loads and snatched his
gun.  The dinghy had drawn out into the lake.
'Stop,' shouted Dick, 'or I'll fire.'  His words
recalled to Norah's brain the games of her childhood,
and in spite of her anxiety she had to smother a
smile.
</p>

<p>
The Indian stopped laughing and crouched in
the bottom of the boat, urging speed on the paddlers.
He put his faith in the increasing range and the
mist which still covered the water.  For some
seconds after every one had recognised the pretence
Dick stood, gun at shoulder, theatrical, ridiculous.
Then with an oath he dropped the Mauser.
</p>

<p>
Already remote, the Indian's laugh rang out above
the là! ... là! ... là! ... of the paddlers,
half chant, half grunt of exertion.
</p>

<p>
Then distance enveloped the sounds.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The position was desperate.  Without ammunition
or stores of food, life was impossible on shore.
Between shore and steamer the water teemed with
crocodiles.  They had no boat or the materials to
build one.  No help could be expected from the
land, no rescue for many days from the lake.
When at last the relief party came, it was
doubtful if there would even be bones for them to
find....
</p>

<p>
But Norah's courage, which had shrunk before
the intangible menace of the bay, rose to meet the
concrete disaster that appeared to have overwhelmed
Dick.  With Changalilo's help she unpacked the
food boxes and measured the margin between them
and starvation.
</p>

<p>
Even the scant array of tins that Changalilo
produced proved to be misleading.  It included such
innutritious aids as baking and curry powder,
anchovies and Worcester sauce&mdash;the armoury of
Colonials against the monotony of ulendo meals.
The solid residue was meagre, for they had brought
on board only enough food for the normal trip of
three days, counting for emergency on the ship's
supplies and on purchases from fishing villages.
What was now left would last them two bare days.
And Alibaba had said that rescue could not come for
twelve.
</p>

<p>
Norah looked towards Dick, who had subsided
on the pile of baggage, his head in his hands.  She
decided to tell Changalilo first.  He accepted the
position with the indifference of one accustomed
to famine, and with the native's inherited
communism added his rations&mdash;a cloth full of millet
meal&mdash;to the common store.
</p>

<p>
'What are you doing?' asked Dick in a dull voice.
</p>

<p>
She turned to him a little brusquely.  After all,
if Dick hadn't quarreled with the Indian, if he
hadn't insisted on sleeping ashore, if he hadn't
wasted his ammunition, they wouldn't be in this
mess.  He ought to pull himself together and help;
there must be some way that a man could find to
retrieve the disaster.
</p>

<p>
She was conscious that she was unfair and
feminine, but with all their independence the present
generation of young women admire a muddler as
little as did their grandmothers.
</p>

<p>
'Come on, Dick,' she said briskly, let's think this
out.'
</p>

<p>
'I've done nothing else, since that swine rowed
off,' said Dick.
</p>

<p>
She made him listen to the result of her
commissariat calculations.
</p>

<p>
'That's worse than I thought,' he said; 'our
number's up.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course it isn't.  Don't be such a pessimist.'
</p>

<p>
Dick drummed on the boxes.  'Unless you can
do a fortnight without food,' he said.
</p>

<p>
She restrained her impatience.
</p>

<p>
'Are you sure you haven't any cartridges anywhere?'
</p>

<p>
'Quite&mdash;I looked through my kit last night.  I
could have sworn...'
</p>

<p>
And while he explained and excused his folly,
Norah wondered what would have happened half
an hour before, had Dick's rifle been loaded.  A
sudden doubt of his resolution assailed her.  With
a loaded gun in his hand, would he have dominated
the mutiny?  In his rage he might have fired, but
in cold blood she doubted if, even to secure their
escape, he could have screwed himself to the killing
point.
</p>

<p>
Surprisingly she was sorry.  Not, I think, from
any hate of the Indian, pre-eminently unlovable as
he was, but from a feeling that if logic barred all
other paths a man should kill.  And as a woman
and an aristocrat, if a life lay between her and
safety, she instinctively demanded a man's love
to ... eliminate the obstacle.
</p>

<p>
In the comparative comfort and security of a
deck chair on an ocean liner, such sentiments seem
blameworthy even in a woman.  In her father's
stately home in the Shires or her father-in-law's
respectable legal circle in Scotland, I have no doubt
that Norah, whom I have presented to you as no
paragon, would have shrunk from so drastic a
solution.  But I suppose standards suffer when you
are in danger of life in Central Africa.
</p>

<p>
In justice I record that she did not pursue the
thought; she turned to wondering what Archie
would have done.  Probably nothing, she decided.
By the time he had weighed the advantages and
disadvantages of drastic action, opportunity would
have flown.  But when at last he moved, she
admitted that Archie generally went to the heart
of the matter.
</p>

<p>
Of one thing she was certain.  His Scottish
stubbornness would not allow him to beg from a man
who had insulted him and whom he had struck.
Nor would he offer money.  She tried to put out of
her mind that picture of her lover, pale in the dawn,
unconscious of the water lapping over his feet,
holding out his purse to his enemy.
</p>

<p>
In this, you may remark, she was unjust.  At
one moment she blamed Dick for not securing her
safety by a cold-blooded murder, at the next she
tried not to despise him for attempting to save her
by the much less reprehensible methods of bribery
and a trifling surrender of pride.
</p>

<p>
She was recalled from her reflections.  Dick had
ended his explanation and had asked her a question.
</p>

<p>
'There must be a way out,' she said at random.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he laughed nervously.  'We could swim
to the <i>Mimi</i> ... at least we could swim the first
ten yards....  Norah,' he said suddenly, 'I believe
that would be the best thing to do.'
</p>

<p>
The part of Norah's brain that was not under
Dick's spell wondered cynically what he would say
if she agreed.  Then she felt ashamed of her sneer.
Was not the greater part of his distress on her
behalf?
</p>

<p>
'We can't make a boat without tools,' he began
again, and rekindled her irritation.  All this talk
of what they couldn't do was utterly vain.  Her
woman's brain had jumped to the only course that
lay open, moving along no path of reason, accepting
the only practicable picture that offered.
</p>

<p>
'Dick,' she said, 'we must strike inland.'
</p>

<p>
'And hardly any of these African woods float,'
went on Dick, monotonously pursuing his line of
thought.  There's no second boat on board.' ... Then
the hope that he had been repressing burst
to the surface.  'Norah,' he said, 'do you think
there's a chance of those paddlers bringing back
the dinghy from the other side?'
</p>

<p>
'No, dear, I don't,' she said gently.  Then, as if
she were dealing with an invalid, 'You see, they
know they've behaved badly, and natives in the
wrong get frightened like naughty children.  They'd
be afraid of being punished, if they came back....
No, as soon as the Indian lets them go, they'll
disappear to their villages.'
</p>

<p>
The last pitiful hope that had lingered,
disappeared.  In his heart, he could almost have cursed
the elopement, which threatened to prove fatal to
both of them.  Yet, as he looked at Norah, the
robuster part of him declared her worth it.  In the
sea of blood spilt for women, no fairer face can have
been mirrored.
</p>

<p>
She stood bare-headed, her short hair stirring,
her chin up and her eyes bright with courage.  He
noticed where the lake sun had caught the skin on
her arms.  It was borne on him that his attitude
lacked worth.  An aristocrat-on-the-scaffold gesture
was indicated.  Or perhaps something more tender.
'Darling,' he whispered, with his faint Irish
intonation, 'I'd die happy in your arms.'
</p>

<p>
As he laid his cheek against hers, he sensed a
slight rigidity.  Had he struck the wrong note?
Norah was sometimes disconcertingly practical.
</p>

<p>
'"There is a time for marrying, and a time for
giving in marriage,"' she quoted under her breath.
'Now, be sensible, Dick,' she went on aloud, 'and
listen to me.  There's no need to talk about dying,
but it's no good looking to the lake for help.  Our
best chance is to strike inland and hope to hit a
village or a native path leading to one.'
</p>

<p>
Dick felt his flourish had miscarried; but in spite
of himself, his sinews were braced by Norah's example.
</p>

<p>
She developed her plan.  Not wasting any of
the forty-eight hours that were assured to them,
they must struggle up the mountain side, the three
of them, with the food on their backs.  When night
overtook them, they would lie between two blazing
fires to protect them against beasts.  Then push on
in the dawn, till they had left the sleeping sickness
belt and reached inhabited country once again.  If
their luck held, they should strike a village or a
village path before their food was gone.
</p>

<p>
'How are you going to get over that?' Dick
waved his arm toward the crater wall.
</p>

<p>
There must be a pass somewhere.'
</p>

<p>
'We may take days to find it.'
</p>

<p>
'We must leave something to chance.'
</p>

<p>
But Dick was no gambler, and the idea of laying
out all their food on the possibility that they would
find a path frightened him.  He thought of the
stories of travellers lost in the bush, walking in
despairing circles.  Where they were, they at least
had water.
</p>

<p>
'It would be better if I went to find the way alone,
without a load on my back, and came back for you.'
</p>

<p>
'If you didn't find it, you'd have to come back
just the same.  We'd be no further on, with a day
wasted.'
</p>

<p>
'A dhow might have come in or a canoe from a
village along the coast.'
</p>

<p>
Norah said nothing.  Though she did not put
into words the criticism of her lover, she knew
the futility of arguing with a man who prefers a
sixty-six to one miracle to a short price chance.
</p>

<p>
After a brief silence Dick expounded his scheme.
There was a hope that the valley of the yellow river
led to a pass.  He would follow the stream to its
source, from every vantage point searching with
field-glasses for sign of human life&mdash;boat on the
lake, path, garden or village in the forest.
</p>

<p>
Norah gave in.  Human eyes she knew could
penetrate short distance into the forest, and she
had small faith in the plan.  But Dick had taken
the initiative, and she was not sure enough of her
own scheme to force its risk on him.  In any case
no time must be wasted in argument.
</p>

<p>
'All right, dear; I'll come the first bit of the climb
with you.'  Her new-born insight into his nature
advised her to keep him under way.  Followed by
Changalilo, they ascended the course of the yellow
stream.
</p>

<p>
Fantastically tangled roots, growing apparently
in air, and a lattice work of creepers formed a wall
that forbade progress along the bank, but, at that
season of the year, it was possible to walk along a
strip of shingle that bordered the bed of the stream.
Up this they toiled until their advance was barred
by a little waterfall, which boiled through a gap
in rocks worn smooth and red, and fell in spray on
the rounded boulders below.
</p>

<p>
Dick decided to deviate into the forest.  From
where they stood it was possible to divine the course
of the river through the trees, until it disappeared
circling round the base of a column or chimney of
natural rock, whose throat torn raggedly open
showed where a small volcano or blowhole had
once belched its stream of lava.  Dick intended to
slant through the forest and rejoin the river by the
chimney.
</p>

<p>
'I'll go back here,' said Norah.  'Changalilo, stay
with Bwana Dick to show him the way back to-night.'
</p>

<p>
'The Bwana said I was never to leave the
Ba-Mama[<a id="chap0110fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0110fn1">1</a>] alone in the forest,' protested Changalilo.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0110fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0110fn1text">1</a>] Ba-Mama&mdash;lit.  "Grandmothers" (plur.).  The respectful term
for all influential ladies&mdash;white women or native princesses.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'What Bwana?' asked Dick.
</p>

<p>
'Bwana A-ri-shy,'[<a id="chap0110fn2text"></a><a href="#chap0110fn2">2</a>] replied Changalilo firmly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0110fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap0110fn2text">2</a>] The Awemba cannot pronounce consecutive consonants
without inserting a vowel.  Changalilo meant Archie.
</p>

<p><br /><br /></p>

<p>
As Norah retraced her steps, she repeated
Changalilo's words.  He still regarded her as Archie's
possession.  In her scorn for the condemnation of
others, it had never entered her head to consider
the opinion of the natives on her flight with Dick.
She knew that while the Chiwemba tongue contains
no word for a virgin&mdash;an ideal that is unfamiliar
to this direct people&mdash;they looked with an
unsympathetic eye on adultery.  The code of the good
old days, before the white men came, allotted death,
she believed, to the guilty pair.  Fantastically
enough, the existence of this point of view in a
backward and little known people carried weight with
her.
</p>

<p>
She dismissed it from her mind and faced the
danger that confronted her.  The practical side of
her nature was uppermost.  She saw that two
factors&mdash;Time and Food&mdash;dominated the situation and
threatened to sign the death warrant.  She could
not shorten the days that must precede a rescue,
she could increase the food supply.  Fish there must
be in the lake, fruit there might be in the ruins.
As she had no fishing tackle, she decided first to
explore the mission.
</p>

<p>
As she approached the ruined tower, the superstitious
dread which the place inspired in her was
reinforced by a more concrete fear of snakes.  She
was a better zoologist than Omar, and knew that
'the keeping of courts where Jamshyd gloried' was
more probably entrusted to puff adders and cobras
than to lions and leopards.
</p>

<p>
But fruit trees would have been planted near
monastery walls, and to the need for food terrors,
supernatural and material, must yield.
</p>

<p>
As she picked her way through the long grass
which surrounded the tower, her foot touched
masonry.  Treading cautiously, she identified the
remnants of a flight of broad steps that once, she
supposed, led to the lake.  Now their easy gradient
was distorted and reft.  At one point they ceased
completely, at others they slanted drunkenly.  The
grass that covered them, knee high, made the ascent
dangerous.
</p>

<p>
She stood at the foot of the tower.  To her right
creeper-grown mounds showed where the chancel
lay.  She penetrated a clump of trees, dark like
citrus, but she found them an outpost of the forest
and no domesticated variety.  Now she could see
a gaping, jagged rift, following the bonding of the
brickwork that explained the quick destruction of
the station.  An earthquake had associated itself
with the more patient forces of the forest in the
work of obliteration.  She wondered that the tower
still stood.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the grass-covered mounds, into which
the monastery walls had decayed, she found a grove
of mangoes ... the late sort whose fruit, it seemed
odd to reflect, might not be ripe till she was
dead.  In what once had been the courtyard some
oranges had reverted to stock.  Even so they were
fruitless, their season past.  Her biggest haul was a
handful of small, hard peaches from what had been
an orchard.  It was doubtful if the trees had ever
flourished in the great heat of lake level.
</p>

<p>
There were no other European trees except the
cypresses that edged the terrace on which the
monastery had stood, their dark spires pointing men
to heaven.  But Norah was reminded of Archie's
farm and the avenue of young cypresses that led to
the new house.  She remembered searching the
forestry catalogue with Archie, and the Latin name
of the Italian cypress&mdash;<i>cypressus funebris</i>&mdash;crossed
her mind with significance now sinister.
</p>

<p>
Another clump of cypresses led her from the main
ruins to an enclosure whose containing wall the
destroying forces had spared.  As she clambered
through a gap she saw the reason of their tolerance.
It was the mission cemetery, and here the pride of
man was already humbled.
</p>

<p>
A crudely-hewn stone proclaimed that Alibaba's
words had been literal, and that at least one of the
White Fathers had died at his post.  She wondered
how long the news had taken to reach the French
village he had left so long ago, and whether there
had been any relatives to remember an old man
who had endured exile, danger, and death for his
faith.
</p>

<p>
Round him, in their almost obliterated graves,
lay his adopted people.
</p>

<p>
The Christian practices are only able to reduce,
by a few years and by the faint memory which
mound and stone briefly preserve, the eternity of
oblivion that waits.  Norah wondered if the old
native form of burial&mdash;an unmarked hole in the
uncharted bush&mdash;was not at once less pretentious
and, when you bargain with infinity, as effective.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
With her miserable handful of peaches, she left
the desolation of the mission for the solitude of
the shore.
</p>

<p>
She must face the problem of catching fish without
tackle or net.  Changalilo's spear, she thought, might
have served, had it not formed the sole defence
of the party in the hills.  Her mind flew to Dick
where he felt his way through the forest.  Why had
she let him go without her?  Suppose, without a
gun, he ran into lion or buffalo!
</p>

<p>
She pulled off the cording of the loads and set
to work.  After more than two hours' labour, a net
of sorts was finished.  Clasping it, she scrambled
on to the breakwater of rocks that the <i>Mimi</i> had
turned as she entered the bay.
</p>

<p>
From talk on the farm, she knew that tiger fish
lie under white cliffs.  These rocks were white&mdash;great
round boulders worn smooth like marble in
the years that had elapsed since they crumbled from
the cliffs above and piled haphazard one on
another.  She had noticed divers and egrets sitting
motionless on the edge.  Where were fishing birds
there must be fish.  As she clambered along the
slippery surface she surprised an otter, sitting in
the sun with head alert and paws spread like a
Landseer lion.  Her precarious approach disturbed
him, as it disturbed the divers, and finally the egrets,
who, with more trust in woman than their plumage
justified, had endured her approach to the last
yard.  Now they flapped with slow-beating wings
in circles round the bay, so white they almost hurt
the eye.
</p>

<p>
Clinging with one hand to a gaunt and stunted
thorn that grew out of no apparent soil, she dragged
the water with her makeshift net.
</p>

<p>
But whether bird, beast and crocodile had already
decimated these waters, or whether her tackle was
inadequate, at the end of an hour she had caught
nothing.  Neither tiger fish with rat-trap teeth that
cut through wire casts, nor iron-grey ngombe, whose
narrow head and jaws fight the fisherman like a
true salmon of the lake, nor yellow, blue-blotched
coupi, nor pande, the gigantic perch of Tanganyika,
rewarded the efforts of her aching arms.
</p>

<p>
The sun scorched pitilessly off the rocks, and,
as pitilessly, thought seared her brain.  When Dick
came back that night without accomplishment, they
would have one day left to eat.  It seemed incredible
that in time of peace and in the twentieth century,
enjoying full health and strength, with money
in her pocket, without an enemy in the world, death
should lurk so near.  But her appetite&mdash;for she had
given Dick the lion's share of the day's
rations&mdash;confirmed her reasoning.
</p>

<p>
The sun was low above the mountains when she
desisted from her unavailing task and returned to
camp.  She noticed with relief that the store of
wood was not spent and she set to work to kindle
a blaze.
</p>

<p>
How much longer would Dick be?  Surely he
would be back before dark!  What news would he
bring?  Her eyes searched the hillside in vain.  She
took her field-glasses to the shore and looking back
she tried to penetrate the maze of trees.  As she
raked the hillside, hope leapt within her.  High up,
near the torn throat of the little volcano, in the
fading light, she saw a native.
</p>

<p>
Dick must have found a village and help was
coming.
</p>

<p>
Then her heart turned to lead.  It was Changalilo
... alone.  Her worst fears had come true:
something had happened to Dick.  The criticism that
had been forming in her mind since the fiasco of the
dinghy fell to dust.  Dick was dead or disabled.
Her gallant, lovely Dick.
</p>

<p>
She would have stumbled into the hills, but fear
that she would miss Changalilo in the dark
restrained her.  She waited.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
An hour she waited, till Changalilo appeared
noiselessly in the firelight.  He saluted in silence.
</p>

<p>
'What has happened?' she forced herself to ask.
</p>

<p>
He did not speak.  Her eyes, which had been
trying to read his expressionless features, fell till
they rested on his hand decorously holding a letter.
She snatched it.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Darling,</i>' it read, '<i>we're saved.  Just seen a camp
fire in the bush.  Chang says it's a white man.
Will spend night with him and join you to-morrow.
All my love</i>.&mdash;DICK.'"
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Ross broke off.  He remarked that the air was a
little cooler and that he thought he could snatch
a little sleep in the interval between stifling night
and sweltering day.
</p>

<p>
We went below.  As we reached the companionway:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"To-morrow," he said.  "I'll tell you how
optimistic was that letter.  No will-o'-the-wisp ever
led wayfarer farther from safety than that camp
fire led Dick."

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
It was midnight before I saw Ross again.  Then
I found him by the odour and glow of his cigar
and by the glint of the masthead lamp on his bald
head.
</p>

<p>
His burly, masculine figure seemed incongruous
among the welter of empty deck-chairs and the
futile debris of a voyage&mdash;women's wraps, rope
quoits, cushions and picture papers.  Side by side
we leant over the rail, and for a while our tongues
were busy with the idiocies that pass for events on
a liner&mdash;the ship's run, the latest quarrel, and so
forth.  A pause gave me the opportunity to remind
him that he was in the middle of a story.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really want to hear it?" he asked,
surprised.  I said that I was interested to know what
happened, resisting the temptation to add that I
could spare some of the moralising with which he
garnished his facts.
</p>

<p>
"About the hour," he began again, "that Norah
received the note, Dick was finishing a second
helping of roan antelope by the side of the fire he had
described.
</p>

<p>
'So I followed for hours,' he was saying, 'till
the path stopped dead at a drinking pool.  Not a
trace beyond.'
</p>

<p>
'Game track,' suggested the stranger on the other
side of the fire.
</p>

<p>
'That's what my "boy" said when we struck it.
I didn't believe a path so well-used and hard-beaten
could be anything but human-made.'
</p>

<p>
'There's not a human for miles,' said the other.
'Except ourselves,' he added, glancing round the
enclosure, where the firelight picked on a cheekbone
or a line of teeth, an eye-ball or the protuberance of
a hip to suggest rather than reveal the presence of a
dozen natives.
</p>

<p>
'There must be rhino by the score,' persisted Dick,
'to flatten out a path like that.'
</p>

<p>
'Zebra do a lot.  The hoofs of a herd of zebra
working regularly between two drinking places.'
</p>

<p>
'Anyhow, neither was much help to me.  So I
decided to push back to ... to my base and try
again to-morrow.  Just before dark I saw your fire.'
</p>

<p>
'Lucky we lit it early.  They're frightened of
lions.  Always are in uninhabited country.'  He
jerked his head in the direction of the palisade
which surrounded the camp.  The farthest glint of
the red fire revealed a sort of ragged fence of
saplings, eight or ten feet high, sharpened and staked
into the ground with leafy boughs laced in between.
</p>

<p>
'You alone?' asked the stranger.
</p>

<p>
'I had only one "boy" with me, and I sent him
back to camp,' prevaricated Dick.
</p>

<p>
In telling his story he had avoided mention of
Norah.  This was only prudent in a country, the
affairs of whose tiny white population are common
property; but the result had made his tale a little
like the Book of Genesis without Eve, and he
realised that to maintain this discretion would be
increasingly difficult.  For the moment, however,
he temporised.
</p>

<p>
His first emotion on catching sight of that point
of light through the trees had been unqualified
delight.  His spirits, which his intimate friends called
'mercurial,' had shot from the depths of despair,
where a day of futile wandering had lodged them,
to an almost arrogant elation.  He only waited to
scribble a line to Norah before he plunged across
country in the direction of the light.
</p>

<p>
But that beacon, as if it possessed the qualities
of the hope it inspired, proved illusive.  Soon night
overtook him struggling through thickets and
stumbling over outcrops.  Perhaps those physical
obstacles imposed a pause for thought, for before
he reached the camp, he had begun to wonder with
what cloak to cover his rather ambiguous position.
For the moment he could only decide on a policy of
caution.  The line he took must vary with the
number, condition, and temper of his rescuers.  It
was possible that he only had to deal with natives.
</p>

<p>
Except that this guess was wrong, scrutiny of
the figure, that sat opposite with eyes shaded from
the fire heat, revealed little.  The mystery may
have been partly due to a lack of interest in third
parties habitual to Dick.  But in truth there did
not seem to be anything very remarkable about the
owner of the fire.  He was youngish, shortish,
darkish.  Not a missionary, one would say, or an
official or a trader, even had that desolate region
offered souls for saving, bodies for the governing,
or wants for the supplying.
</p>

<p>
That he was no plutocrat progressing triumphantly
across the continent on a well-boomed shooting
trip, the absence of blameless hecatombs of
slaughtered buck and poisoned carnivora proclaimed.
The modesty of his appointments&mdash;Dick was reposing
his aching limbs on a packing-case and his host
was as ill-provided&mdash;and the shabbiness of his torn
shorts and frayed shirt underlined the point.  Taken
all round, an unnoteworthy man whom you would
never pick out of a crowd.  But as there was no
crowd for a thousand miles to pick him from, the
appearance of the Apollo Belvedere could not have
been more welcome, or indeed more surprising.
</p>

<p>
Several leading questions designed to dispel the
mystery were allowed to fall to the ground unanswered.
</p>

<p>
It is not impossible that, irritated by these feelers,
the stranger was moved to repay in like coin.  At
any rate he followed up his disconcerting, 'You
alone?' with a no less awkward, 'I don't know your
name?'
</p>

<p>
'Brown,' said Dick Ward, after a moment's pause.
</p>

<p>
'Ah!' said the unknown, eyeing him, to Dick's
mind, a trifle aggressively.  'Mine's Smith,' he
added after a pause.
</p>

<p>
Suspicion of mockery crossed Dick's mind, causing
him to glance quickly at his host.  He appeared
immersed in thought.  At length he produced the
result of his deliberations.
</p>

<p>
'Better start at dawn,' he said.
</p>

<p>
'Start?' echoed Dick.  'Where for?'
</p>

<p>
'Abercorn,' was the monosyllabic reply.
</p>

<p>
The announcement was not to Dick's taste.  In
the first place he did not like his plans made for
him.  Moreover, in his sanguine heart he had reckoned
on a loan of at least enough provisions to carry
Norah and himself to the nearest white settlement.
</p>

<p>
But now the man Smith was proposing&mdash;almost
dictating&mdash;a double back into Rhodesia and an
amalgamation of forces that would discover Norah's
presence.  And, as there were people at Abercorn
who knew both her and Archie, he would have to
tell the truth.
</p>

<p>
A shade stiffly then (it would never occur to Dick
that Smith was in a position to offer whatever
arrangement suited him) he replied that he didn't
think he could manage to make for Abercorn,
adducing as an excuse the state of his feet, which had
suffered from the stony and precipitous route he
had that day followed.
</p>

<p>
Smith heard him out without any expression on
his face that would reveal his opinion.  'Matao,'
he said to his capitao, 'the fire.'  He seemed to
collapse into his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
A native, naked save for his blanket, extracted
his sprawling limbs from the fire-lit group that
talked in sibilant whispers only broken by
suppressed laughter at some scandalous tale.  From the
firewood pile he pulled the pale trunk of a tree long
dead, eaten to a skeleton by white ants, and pitched
it on to the fire.  The impact released a shower of
sparks and a flicker of flames that lit the underside
of the overhanging boughs, showing their leaves
livid against the richness of the sky, like the pattern
on a brocade.
</p>

<p>
That's right, Matao,' said Smith, and relapsed
into silence.  Then, with the tone of one who had
been reasoning all the time&mdash;'You see,' he said
to Dick, 'you see, I haven't anything I can leave
you.  I haven't any tins myself or meal for my
carriers.  So I can't give you any.'
</p>

<p>
Dick, to whom salvation had seemed assured,
felt as if he had been pushed off a cliff.  'We're
living on what I shoot,' went on Smith after a
pause; 'unfortunately I'm short of ammunition.
Bloody short.  What guns have you got?'
</p>

<p>
'Seven point nine Mauser and a heavy Westley
Richards,' replied Dick dully.
</p>

<p>
'So, even if I could spare you any, it wouldn't
fit.'  Smith seemed to muse.  'I've got a 7.9
at home,' he continued.  'I might have a round
or two in my bag.  But not enough to be any use.'
</p>

<p>
A native rose from the fire and disappeared in
the direction of the tent, returning at once with
the stranger's heavy rifle.  Some word understood
in the conversation had recalled an unfulfilled task.
He took his place by the fire and, producing a bundle
of bits of rag, Rangoon oil and a pull-through, sat
cross-legged cleaning the gun.
</p>

<p>
'That's Johnny, my fundi,'[<a id="chap0201fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0201fn1">1</a>] said Smith.  'Saved
my life the other day.  Didn't you, Johnny?'
</p>

<p>
The native, who did not understand a word,
laughed and his teeth flashed white in the darkness.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0201fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0201fn1text">1</a>] "Fundi"&mdash;native hunter.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'So,' went on Smith, whose conversation seemed
to follow his thoughts rather than his words, 'we'll
have to stick together and do long days to Abercorn
and live on what I shoot.  I've got ammunition
waiting at Abercorn,' he added.
</p>

<p>
Dick saw that Norah's presence could no longer
be concealed.  He had no other excuse for rejecting
the stranger's scheme.  He wished he had been more
open from the beginning.  Confession was difficult
now.  In any case a complete explanation to this not
very sympathetic stranger was unthinkable.  He
took the plunge.
</p>

<p>
'You see, there's my wife,' was his phrase.
</p>

<p>
The stranger looked at him as if he were going
to speak.  But when ultimately he did, it was only
to say, 'You didn't tell me Mrs. Brown was with
you.'
</p>

<p>
Dick saw that silence was his best defence, and
held his tongue while Smith submerged into one
of his periods of thought.  Dick waited anxiously
on the words of this rather mysterious being who
held Norah's life and his in his hands.  Eventually
the arbiter of destinies spoke; more exactly, he
whistled.
</p>

<p>
'We're in a bit of a hole,' he said.
</p>

<p>
That first person plural relaxed Dick's tautened
muscles.
</p>

<p>
'We'd never get a lady as far as Abercorn,' Smith
continued.  Dick agreed with a whole heart.  'I've
only got enough carriers for my loads.  None for
her kit, let alone a machila....  If I increased
their loads, we'd never make the distance.'
</p>

<p>
'How far is it?' asked Dick.
</p>

<p>
'God knows.  I'm a stranger in this country, so
are my natives.  From what you tell me of your
trip up the lake we must be over two hundred miles
from the south end.  Abercorn's twenty miles on....
That's by water&mdash;dodging mountains and
ravines makes it longer.  For instance, there's a
road on the other side between M'pala and Badouinville.
It's three hours by water and two days on
foot.'
</p>

<p>
'Then why Abercorn?' asked Dick, attaining his
objective.
</p>

<p>
Smith explained that while he didn't know his
way to any Boma or settlement on this side of the
water, Abercorn would be found by following the
lake.  And touch need never be lost with drinking
water.
</p>

<p>
'But it's out of the question now,' he declared.
'I was counting on doing it in a fortnight.  With
the dozen odd rounds I've got, luck and good shooting,
we should have been all right for food.  But
Mrs. Brown could never do twenty-five-mile days.'
</p>

<p>
Dick agreed.
</p>

<p>
'I suppose you think,' began Smith, and stopped.
'I'd better tell you,' he began again, 'what I'm
doing here without ammunition or food.  Else
Mrs. Brown may wonder....'
</p>

<p>
Dick murmured a deprecatory phrase, which
fortunately for his curiosity was ignored.
</p>

<p>
The account which the stranger proceeded to give
of himself was not very detailed.  He had, Dick
gathered, been after elephant somewhere in the
Congo.  Wonderful game country, not far from the
lake.  So many elephant that he had used up most
of his big bore ammunition.  He had plenty of .303
stuff, but his .303 rifle had been twisted into scrap
metal by the wounded bull Johnny had saved him
from.  (Hundred-pound tusks he had.)  Then he
got into trouble with the Bulamatadi.  ('Poaching,'
thought Dick.)  So that there was question of
confiscating his ivory.  He'd got too much to risk losing,
and he'd induced a fishing village to paddle him and
his ulendo across to the British side.
</p>

<p>
'A bit risky, wasn't it, in a canoe at this time
of year?' suggested Dick.  'What if a squall got
up?'
</p>

<p>
'Risky?' repeated Smith.  'Yes, I suppose so.  I
had to pay the paddlers pretty high.  Or rather their
headman.  I couldn't get enough canoes, either.
That's why I left most of my stuff behind.'
</p>

<p>
He had crossed at night and landed a day's stage
north of the present camp.  Dick mentally supplied
the missing detail of a reverent burial of the ivory
on the beach.  Now he was on his way to Abercorn.
</p>

<p>
'But of course I'll stay and see you and your
wife through,' he added.
</p>

<p>
Dick was suitably grateful, but Smith was apparently
already thinking of something else.
</p>

<p>
'We'll have to see what can be done,' he went
on.  'Maybe my chaps could build a raft and we
could edge our way along the coast till we reach a
fishing village....  I'd better move camp
alongside of you first thing to-morrow and get to work,'
he reflected.  A sudden thought seemed to strike
him, 'I suppose Mrs. Brown has got a gun.'
</p>

<p>
Dick explained that the gun was ammunitionless.
</p>

<p>
'But,' protested Smith, 'you can't leave her alone
there without a gun!'
</p>

<p>
'You're safe from crocs, on land, aren't you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, I think so, but...'
</p>

<p>
'She's got lots of firewood.'  Dick was not as easy
as he pretended, but he resented his host's
interference, 'and there's not a hope of finding our way
down in the dark.  It's nearly vertical in parts,
and I'm not sure of the way.  Even in the daylight
we'll have to wait for my "boy" to guide us.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, she's your wife, not mine,' said Smith,
prompted possibly by some attendant angel with
a taste for Greek irony.
</p>

<p>
As if to dismiss the matter, he reached out and
offered Dick a cigarette.  The metal of the case
caught Dick's eye as he accepted, for elephant
hunters do not, as a rule, sport gold, and curiosity
impelled him to decipher the words engraved inside.
The fire had sunk to a glow, but the sardonic-minded
angel, anxious to see the fun, whispered to
the stranger to kick the smouldering logs, and a
tongue of flame licked high enough for Dick to
read the words 'Archie from Norah' followed by a
date that his retina had not recorded, ere the light
had sunk.
</p>

<p>
There shot through Dick's being a fear as luminous
as that arrow of fire and as quickly sped.  Of
course, even in the small white circle of Central
Africa there must be lots of men named 'Archie,'
who were given things by women called 'Norah.'  Why
should not Smith's Christian name be Archie?
'Archie Smith,' a perfectly convincing combination.
</p>

<p>
He could not help recalling with faint uneasiness
that suspicion of mockery when the stranger
declared his name.  Had he been given a Roland for
his Oliver, a Smith for his Brown?
</p>

<p>
But, even if his name were not Smith, why
should it be Sinclair?  Archie Sinclair, who was
hundreds of miles away 'on cattle business,'
presumably at Elizabethville.
</p>

<p>
With a start he realised that his host had asked
him a question.  Intent on the problem of the man's
identity, he chanced assent, and was relieved when
the answer proved adequate.
</p>

<p>
Of course the fellow might have found or even
stolen the case.  It certainly was not natural for
a hunter to possess such an article ... if he were
an elephant hunter.  He was up to the knees in a
morass of uncertainties; there seemed no bottom to
the mystery; but until he was on firm ground,
exhausted as he was, he knew he would not sleep.  How
could he get at the truth?  One couldn't very well
say to a man, 'I say, Smith, is your name Sinclair?
Because, if so, I'm sleeping with your wife.'  Nor
could he interrogate natives in their master's
presence.
</p>

<p>
Whatever happened, he must escape from this
morose tête-à-tête, whose suppressions were driving
him to idiocy.  Conversation, he felt, would choke
him; without it solution was no nearer.  He rose
to his feet with a gesture of weariness that was not
assumed.
</p>

<p>
'You must take my bed,' said the putative Smith,
moved again by the Spirit with a taste for <i>double
entendre</i>.
</p>

<p>
He escorted Dick to the tent and left him there
while he went to give orders for his own bed of
leaves.  Once alone, no pedantic delicacy restrained
Dick.  With the flair of a private detective, he found
a handkerchief.  Granted a good wife, this might
solve the question.  But the emblem 'A.S.' that
rewarded his search and testified to a modicum of
wifely devotion, only reduced the field to Archies,
Sinclair or Smith.
</p>

<p>
It was not until he thought of looking under
the bed that the myth of the latter's existence was
exploded.  There lay an old uniform case which its
owner had preserved from army days.  Painted on
it, he read, '2nd Lieut. Archibald Sinclair, R.F.A.'"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0202"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
After the manner of men in love, Dick seems
to have enjoyed discussing his emotions with
Norah.  So, building on what she told me, I can
reconstruct in some degree his feelings on that
remarkable evening.
</p>

<p>
It appears that even the culminating evidence of
the uniform case did not satisfy him, so reluctant is
<i>homo sapiens</i> to admit unwelcome truth.  He
wanted to know more.  How could Archie be here?
There was not time for him to have gone back
to the farm, to have found Norah's letter, and
followed.  To catch them, a pursuer would have had
to overtake before the <i>Mimi</i> was boarded&mdash;the only
boat that called at the Rhodesian end of the lake.
</p>

<p>
But what about that wandering 'stiff' who, he
remembered Norah saying, had started for the
Congo with her husband.  Might not this be he?
Suppose he had stolen Sinclair's kit at Elizabethville
and was making for an East Coast port?
</p>

<p>
Dick's reluctance to look truth in the eye was
removed by Archie's return to the tent, where a
couch of leaves had been heaped.  One of the grunts,
with which he settled himself, matured into more
or less coherent speech, 'By the way, sorry ... my
name's not Smith ... Sinclair....  Thought I
ought to tell you....  Good-night.'
</p>

<p>
Even a purist when hit on the head with a
hammer ceases to argue whether coal or sledge.  Dick
was reduced to accepting facts at face value.
</p>

<p>
A stronger man might have seized the moment
to face it out, while Archie's words held the door
open to confession.  A line too direct for Dick.
He did nothing&mdash;not from fear, as he explained
no doubt truthfully to Norah, but from a sense of
the supreme awkwardness of the position.  That
was how he put it: you would probably say 'seeing
what a poor fish he'd look.'
</p>

<p>
It is possible, even easy, to seduce a man's wife
with a certain air.  The gesture has been made
picturesque, amusing, sublime, according to the
clothes, characters, circumstances of the puppets.
Don Juan, Casanova, young Lochinvar were masters
of the different genres.
</p>

<p>
But collect your troop on a desert island of
limited acreage, give Menelaus the sole power of
rescue, and the laughter veers round against Paris.
Worse still, Helen might lead it.  And when you
throw in one loaded rifle and give it to Menelaus,
the romantic farce may degenerate into tragedy.
</p>

<p>
Dick, whatever he told Norah, cannot have been
long realising that his position was not only false
but dangerous, and his life at the mercy of the
man he had wronged.  He may not have expected
actual violence, for Norah's allusions to her husband
at that date of her disillusionment would have
outlined a deliberate, cautious, rather pale-blooded
being in whom civilisation had destroyed all sudden
impulse.  One who had reduced 'soundness' to a
vice and was lamentably sure 'to do the sensible
thing'; who, meditating both sides of every
question and avoiding the ill-considered move, had
almost lost power of action.  One of those irritating
people who are too busy giving the devil his due to
reach for the holy water.
</p>

<p>
Since Dick, like the rest of us, preferred to use
labels and pigeon-holes instead of observation and
thought, he did not stop to compare this pallid
creation with the lean, taciturn individual who slept
a few feet from him.
</p>

<p>
But although the eminently 'sound' man of Dick's
and Norah's fancy does not go about shooting people
even on considerable provocation, he is not, Dick
argued, of the type that steps far out of the way
to save the lives of enemies.
</p>

<p>
There are men who would never tolerate the
unsavoury and dangerous business of murder, but
who would make slight effort to prevent the death
of an enemy out of sight and earshot&mdash;witness the
mediæval popularity of the oubliette.  So Dick did
not find unconvincing the figure of an outraged
husband who pursued his way to Abercorn and left the
identified Mr. and Mrs. Brown to shift for themselves.
</p>

<p>
Fear of some such fate is the only excuse I can
find for the scheme which he afterwards confessed
to Norah.  It was, he said, the only way out of the
impasse.  It does not seem to have occurred to him
that there was anything unsporting in his plan, any
gleam of the phosphorescent aura of treachery.  If
pressed, he might have produced the old excuse
about Love and War; a sophism, which, pushed
to logical extremes, justifies, I suppose, arsenic in
the Burgundy and babies on the bayonet.
</p>

<p>
An acute moral sense was never Dick's weakness;
still, one would have expected common sense to save
him from the stupidity of confiding in Norah his
happy thought of stealing her husband's gun and
leaving him and his natives to ... fend for
themselves.  He must have been very sure of the spell his
adoration cast.
</p>

<p>
No doubt Africa was probing him too deep.  In
the last twenty-four hours she had unmasked batteries
too heavy for her victim.  Blow on blow had
been hammered at his weakest points.  She had
opened with her favourite gambit of starvation and
had daunted his courage with its shadow.  She had
lowered his vitality by an interminable day of
incessant toil and disappointed hope.  She
tormented him with the sudden display of a salvation
that faded into a trap from which there was no
honourable issue.
</p>

<p>
Her machinery was ponderous enough to shatter
the morale of a finer man than Dick.  It was like
shooting rabbits with a field-gun.  Dick was that not
uncommon flower of our civilisation&mdash;a thoroughly
charming fellow.  Just the man for a dance at your
house, a rubber at your club, a week-end at your
partridges.  Good-looking, well-dressed, well-mannered,
it was impossible not to like him at sight.
</p>

<p>
Alas! the forest cares nothing for looks, clothes,
or manners.
</p>

<p>
The mild fires of public-school and life about
town had not tempered his metal hard enough.  He
had had an easy war, largely spent at Bolo House.
In his spells at the front, he had the support of
discipline, example, comradeship; responsibility had
been lifted from his shoulders.  Now he had to
fight a duel with Africa for an opponent....  And
hate, that the war taught us so quickly kills all
sense of sportsmanship, blindfolded him.
</p>

<p>
As he thought of his dependence on the man he
had wronged, his heart contracted.  He was so
ignominiously at the mercy of one on whom he had
hitherto bestowed a smile of pity.
</p>

<p>
And why?  Not because his enemy was braver,
or cleverer, or a better man in any way, but just
because he had a loaded rifle.  From whatever angle
he regarded this intolerable triangle, the gun
dominated.  Looked at as a means of securing food, in
Archie's prejudiced hands, it dictated terms.  As a
weapon of offence, it imposed no less.  So long as
Archie held this card, Dick and Norah were
impotent, immobilised, compelled ignobly to confess
their liaison and accept starvation or such humiliating
terms as their master saw fit to stipulate.
</p>

<p>
Archie was the common enemy whose advantage
must be torn from him without consideration of his
ultimate fate.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The tent in which Dick and his intended victim
were sleeping was small, some eight feet by six, a one
man load.  He could not help contrasting his own
luxurious installation with double fly, bathroom and
verandah.  Here was barely room for the two men
to sleep.  On the ground between them lay the gun,
but close to Archie's hand.  The firelight showing
through the canvas gave a dull gleam off the barrels.
It was not a magazine rifle, and the two rounds in
the chambers would not go far.  Archie's ammunition
bag, which lay behind his head, must be secured.
</p>

<p>
His deep breathing proclaimed sleep.  God send
the natives by the fire slept as sound.
</p>

<p>
Moving an inch at a time to minimise the creaking
of the camp bed, Dick reached out and out till his
muscles were ready to snap.  At last he secured the
strap and lifted the bag gently to him.  The rifle
fell an easier prey.
</p>

<p>
With heart throbbing in the silence he lay still,
waiting for the flames to die down and mask his
sortie.  It seemed hours before the firelight faded.
He must act before a native woke to heap on fresh
fuel.  With infinite pains not to break the silence,
he rose from his bed.  His heart stood still at a
leopard's bark.  There was no break in Archie's
breathing.  Picking his way through the stray leaves
that strewed the ground, he tiptoed to the door.
</p>

<p>
He must have made a sound in unlacing the flap.
</p>

<p>
'What is it?' came Archie's quiet voice.
</p>

<p>
'I heard something.'
</p>

<p>
'Lion?'
</p>

<p>
'Leopard, I thought.'
</p>

<p>
Archie was beside him.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you,' he said, and took the gun.  Dick
had already laid the cartridge bag on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Together they interrogated the sleepers by the
fire.  Archie&mdash;'damnably thorough,' thought
Dick&mdash;searched for spoor with a hurricane lamp.
</p>

<p>
'I must have imagined it,' said Dick, when they
had regained the tent.
</p>

<p>
'Looks like it,' replied Archie dryly.  Then 'Wake
me next time you want my gun,' he said.
</p>

<p>
But whatever suspicion he may have framed about
his guest, it did not keep him awake, and soon his
regular breathing formed an accompaniment to
Dick's night thoughts.  Not that they were very
coherent.  The grotesque failure of his plot, whose
attempt, you must admit, had taken some resolution,
left him physically exhausted and emptied.  He lay
crushed almost beyond feeling, while the hours that
were left him to find a solution passed.
</p>

<p>
Consciousness of this flight of time forced him
to bend his will to fresh scheming.  But his anxious
thought produced nothing more heroic than the decision
to ask Norah what to do.  After all it was she
who had deserted Archie, and she ought to have her
say in the handling of him.  As soon as it was light
he would slip down and lay the matter before her.
'Shift the responsibility on to her,' would have been
honester phrasing, for Dick was by now a beaten
man.
</p>

<p>
But even this wouldn't work.  The curse of abortion
seemed to descend on every plan he devised.  If
he left at dawn, Archie, his suspicions over the name
question reinforced by the gun episode, would be
only too glad to start on his way without wasting
more time over an unsatisfactory individual who
fortunately had disappeared.
</p>

<p>
And with Archie, intolerable thought, would
vanish hope of life.  Everything seemed to swing
round in a vicious circle to focus the spotlight on
the whip in Archie's hand.
</p>

<p>
Was there no other course than a full confession
at the eleventh hour?  To wake the man up and
say, 'I've seduced your wife, I've told you a pack of
lies.  I've tried to steal your gun and leave you to
starve.  Now will you get me out of this hole,
please?'
</p>

<p>
It wasn't thinkable.  At the same time, it was
inevitable.  What else....  What else...."

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
The mountains still stemmed the morning
sunlight when Archie, who had dressed by
the ashes of his fire, sat down to await the arrival of
the guide who was to lead the way down the hills.
Until he came there seemed no object in waking
Brown or whatever his real name was.
</p>

<p>
By nature incurious, Archie could not help
suspecting that there was something wrong about the
man.  It was not natural to find so feckless a being
alone in the wilds.  He seemed, moreover, to have
something to conceal.  Archie liked them with less
looks and more honesty.  What the devil had he
been doing in the middle of the night with his gun?
A queer bird.
</p>

<p>
But the man was in a hole&mdash;a baddish hole&mdash;and
out here it was up to one white man to help another.
He began to make plans.  Most of them were
blocked by the man's wife.  You couldn't ask a
woman to do too much.  What sort of a wife would
the chap have?  Something fair and fluffy and
adoring, he decided.  He wasn't too sure they were
married.  That would explain some of the mystery
... not that it was any of his business.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As he came to this fallacious conclusion, the thin
sweetness of whistling trickled through the quiet of
the forest like tinsel against night.
</p>

<p>
'Another white man,' thought Archie.  'The place
is like Piccadilly.'  Then he reflected that
Mrs. Brown must be coming up the hill to join her
husband and wondered with a twist of his lip whether
she would have the presence of mind to answer to
that name.
</p>

<p>
The whistling started again, closer.  Why did
that syncopated phrase bring the colour of emeralds
before his eyes?  Were the words about emeralds?
More like Kentucky, Tennessee, and the rest of the
rural spots that American song writers ache to
revisit.
</p>

<p>
Then he remembered: it was an emerald green
shawl crossed tightly over a woman's flexible
shoulders.  The fringe hung to the ankle whose
silk-clad movement caught and lost the light as her
foot tapped to the rhythm.  Her back was framed
in the lighted blank of a long window that gave on
to the London street where he stood smoking.  Dawn
was near, and a grey light invaded the ball-room,
revealing the pallor of the electricity, the withering
of the flowers, the weariness of the women.
</p>

<p>
She had half turned to her companion, and
Archie, invisible in the square, had rested his gaze
on the silhouetted curve of her cheek.  She moved
again, and it gripped his heart to see how tired her
eyes were.  What a little thing she looked with her
figure held firmly by that emerald shawl!
</p>

<p>
Funny how the whistled tune recalled that picture
of Norah and all that sort of life....  Ah, well! in
a few months now, when the cattle deal was through
and the ivory sold, he'd have made her happy by
taking her back.  The price of ivory must be
somewhere about twelve shillings now, but...
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At that moment Norah stepped into the sunlit
clearing.  Coming from under the close shadow of
the forest, she was dazzled, the oblique rays of the
sun shining in her face.  Archie rose to meet her,
amazed.  How had she found him?  What had
brought her?  What was her need of him?
</p>

<p>
Never free with words, wonder held him silent,
conscious only of gladness that she was there.  But
gladness left him when recognition dawned in the
shocked eyes she shaded from the sun.  Not for him,
they revealed, had she come.
</p>

<p>
Her arm raised against the sun went out, pushing
something away, and her face as she looked down
was bloodless.  So she stood for a second, then up
went her chin with the old defiant gesture.
</p>

<p>
'Why did you follow me?' she said, her deep
voice damped down till he could hardly hear.
</p>

<p>
'Follow you?' he repeated.
</p>

<p>
'Didn't you understand what I wrote?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
The pause which followed was long, even for
Archie's conversational methods.  Speech was forced
on her again.
</p>

<p>
'The letter I left you at the farm.'
</p>

<p>
'The farm?  I've been in the Congo.'
</p>

<p>
'You don't know...?'
</p>

<p>
'Know what, Norah?' his voice, usually
expressionless, seemed to plead; 'tell me, what has
happened.'
</p>

<p>
'In a minute, Archie.  Give me that
packing-case to sit on, will you.  I've been on short rations
lately.'
</p>

<p>
She noticed that, bringing the box, he fumbled
like a blind man.
</p>

<p>
He pressed her to have breakfast before she
talked.
</p>

<p>
'No,' she said, 'I must get this over first,' and
regretted the ungracious words when she saw him
flinch.  If you mind that...' she began.  'Archie,
you mustn't mind anything about me.  I can't bear
you to mind.'
</p>

<p>
His reply fell so low that she had to strain her
ears to catch it.  The words confirmed her flash of
understanding.
</p>

<p>
'You,' he murmured reluctantly, 'are the only
thing I mind about.  As long as nothing's happened
to you.'
</p>

<p>
A few seconds had passed since Norah had stepped
into the sun.  In that space she had ranged the gamut
of emotion.  The first sight of Archie had dazzled
her brain, as the sun her eyes.  For a moment the
earth had reeled in a vertigo.  And its reeling hurled
her into a lake of shame that stung like the fumes of
ammonia: shame at the ludicrous, the indecent
figure she cut.  Anger succeeded.  Anger with
Archie, whose pursuit had put her in this intolerable
position.  How like a man, she thought, to come
to recapture the woman he had not troubled to keep!
How blundering!  How undignified!
</p>

<p>
Archie's first words dispelled her resentment.  And
his patent sincerity was troubling.  Was there some
mistake? ... And somehow she saw Archie for
the first time for months&mdash;or was it years?&mdash;saw
something she had missed....  Archie's rigid face,
his voice so resolutely kept from trembling told her
there was another unconsidered facet in her romance.
With all her high thinking, her regard for loyalty,
bond, rights, she had missed the one factor that
denied her freedom&mdash;that Archie might still care.
</p>

<p>
He cared.  Must have cared all the time.  The
distress he failed to conceal did not spring from the
outraged vanity of a husband wounded in his pride
of possession.  The hurt was deeper, deep in his
undemonstrative heart.
</p>

<p>
She was naturally sensitive to others' suffering,
and it seemed to her that not only Archie, not only
herself, but the whole forest vibrated with pain.
She had created it: nothing she could do would
dull it.
</p>

<p>
She found herself resenting the pity that tore her
heart&mdash;that desolating, impotent, futile pity!  What
was the good of pity, affection even, for Archie,
when it was passion she felt for Dick.  All that
remorse could do was to blunt, to sully that passion.
It was too late to think of Archie's feelings now.
She could only go forward.
</p>

<p>
'Archie!' she said.  He was standing with his
back turned to her, his hands deep in his pockets,
clenched, they must have been, and tightly, for the
veins on his arms to stand up like that.  'Archie,
stay there, don't turn round till I've told you.'
</p>

<p>
He made neither sign nor sound.
</p>

<p>
'Archie, I think I'm going to hurt you.  I've
only just seen...'  Words, words which altered
nothing, spared nothing.  She spoke quickly, raising
her voice.  'That letter, the letter that's waiting
at the farm, said I was ... was leaving you.'
</p>

<p>
'Leaving me,' he repeated her statement, his voice
toneless like a sleep-walker's.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he whipped round, for the instant
mastered by his emotion.  He caught her shoulder
and held her at arm's length.  That night she found
the bruise, but at the time she felt the pain no
more than he knew he inflicted it.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Norah, why?  I thought we were going
to be so happy.  I never knew.  Never guessed.  Tell
me, why?'
</p>

<p>
She felt explanation impossible.  Her hands came
out to touch him, but fell helpless to her sides.
</p>

<p>
'But I never meant to hurt you so, my dear,' she
said.
</p>

<p>
He let go of her shoulder, slowly, regretfully,
as though he touched her body for the last time.
</p>

<p>
'There's nothing,' he said.  'Nothing I can do?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  His hopes must be killed.
</p>

<p>
'There's another man,' she said.
</p>

<p>
'That&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Dick Ward,' she interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
'That fellow who came to my fire last night?'
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Why in hell did I let them light the fire,' he said.
'He'd have starved then.'
</p>

<p>
He walked abruptly to the tent and kicked at the
flap.
</p>

<p>
'Come out of that!'
</p>

<p>
'What's the matter?'  Dick's voice did not sound
as unconcerned as he would have wished.
</p>

<p>
'You come out!'
</p>

<p>
'No need to speak like that,' and Dick emerged.
He thought it wise to ignore Archie.  'Hallo, Norah,'
he said.  'Why didn't you wait at the camp?'
</p>

<p>
The assumption of ownership was ill-timed.
Archie's sunburnt face went brick red, and he came
very close to Dick.
</p>

<p>
'If you don't clear out, I'll break you up.'
</p>

<p>
Dick Ward towered above his adversary, but
there his advantage ended.  He carried too much
flesh, and his splendid torso looked best under a
tennis shirt.  But Archie's muscles had been worked
into steel by twenty-five-mile days after elephant,
and made him as awkward an opponent as a
six-inch shell.
</p>

<p>
'My dear Sinclair,' said Dick, 'we must talk this
over like men of the world.'  The tone of patronage
alone would have been enough.  Archie's feet shifted
and his right knee turned and bent for the upper-cut
that in another second would have smashed upwards
under Dick's jaw, when Norah's low voice broke
in:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Archie!  Dick!  Don't; you're making things worse!'
</p>

<p>
Her instinct was to save her lover.  He was in
danger, he was her lover.  The pity she had lately
felt for Archie was in a way disloyalty to Dick.
</p>

<p>
The men stood tense.  Archie did not relax his
wound-up muscles.
</p>

<p>
'Archie!' she cried, whipping her nerves that
anger might overlay compassion, 'Archie, come here.
For the love of God, behave like a civilised being!'
</p>

<p>
'I told him to go,' said Archie sullenly.  But he
lowered his eyes from his enemy's and his fist slowly
loosened.
</p>

<p>
'How can he go?'
</p>

<p>
'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
'Where can he go to?  Do you mean him to
starve?'
</p>

<p>
Archie shrugged his shoulders.  What happened
to Dick was indifferent to him, provided he went.
Norah blew on the embers of her passion to kindle
a blaze that should scorch pity from her heart.
</p>

<p>
'Very well.  We'll go,' she said.
</p>

<p>
Archie did not answer and silence closed in on
them, a sinister silence like the patch of calm in
the centre of a typhoon.  They waited.  Dick paced
about the camp.  He did not try to hide the commotion
of his nerves.  To Norah sitting still on her box,
time seemed to be measured into lengths.  Something
must come now ... or now ... or now.
</p>

<p>
And as she waited, she watched over the trees a
falcon with the blue-grey plumage of a dove hang
under the hard blue heaven motionless, save for its
questing head.  Then it swooped.  Would Archie's
completed thought deal death like that?
</p>

<p>
But when he spoke it was in a lower tone.
</p>

<p>
'I'm not sure,' he said.  'I don't know what to do.
Norah'&mdash;he turned to her with appeal in his eyes&mdash;'I
must be quiet, don't you see, and think.  I must
get things clear.'
</p>

<p>
This was an Archie whom Norah knew better than
the hard, decided, almost fierce animal that had just
threatened Dick.  He wanted to think things out.
</p>

<p>
'I must be alone,' he went on; then flamed out
again.  'For God's sake send him away for half an
hour.'
</p>

<p>
'Dick,' said Norah steadily, 'you'd better go down
to the camp.'  His eyes signalled to her to come too.
Archie divined the intention.
</p>

<p>
'Norah,' he began, 'don't, just for now, don't...'
then bitterness broke over him.  'Oh, well, it doesn't
matter by now, does it?'
</p>

<p>
She resigned herself to the rack and promised to
stay with him while Dick went down to the lake.
But Archie spared her.  He was going, he said, to
walk in the hills, and called Matao to give her
breakfast.
</p>

<p>
'I ought to have seen that Ward had breakfast,'
he said.  Then as he paced away into the forest she
thought she could detect the words, 'they serve
breakfast in the condemned cell....'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In moments of danger Norah's romanticism had a
way of lapsing, leaving her as practical as a Swiss
hotel-keeper.  She ate a good meal of cold roan.
She knew she would need all her strength to keep
Archie and Dick apart.  Moreover, if this was to
be her last breakfast, it should be a good one.
</p>

<p>
She did not suppose that even this new, incalculable
Archie contemplated leaving her to starve;
she was less sure about his plans for Dick.  And of
course she would stay with Dick.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  'Her honour rooted in dishonour stood.<br />
  And faith unfaithful kept her falsely true.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
A tag that Miss Briggs had taught her in the schoolroom
as an example of some eccentricity of grammar
or other.  It was sometimes true of life.
</p>

<p>
She must be prepared for anything.  Archie
might not act in hot blood: he might think things
out, but she was not reassured.  The Archie she
knew had a habit of logical thought.  And if this
unfamiliar man of action came to the conclusion
that it was not his business to succour the enemy
within his gates, he would translate his ideas into
deeds.
</p>

<p>
As she meditated the change she saw in Archie, a
sound caught her ear, and looking up she saw Dick
signalling to her from the edge of the clearing.
With a shrug she walked across to him.  She noticed
that his hair was still untidy and his clothes
crumpled from the night spent without his gear.
</p>

<p>
'This isn't fair!' she said, when she reached him.
</p>

<p>
'Is he here?' he asked anxiously.
</p>

<p>
'Archie's in the hills, but I promised ... why
couldn't you wait?'
</p>

<p>
He stepped into the open.  'I couldn't, Norah,
not alone; down on that shore.'
</p>

<p>
'I did last night.'  She did not tell him she had
not dared sleep or that she had taken to the hills
as soon as she could see the white mist that rose from
the warm water of the lake.
</p>

<p>
'I didn't have much of a night either,' said Dick,
and related how Archie's identity had been disclosed.
</p>

<p>
He told his story in jerks, with quick glances
over his shoulder and exaggerated gestures.  Norah
guessed that his nerves were breaking under the
strain.  His poise, his assurance was shattered.  His
debonair bearing had shrunk to the rags of a swagger
that he pulled round him when fear allowed.
</p>

<p>
'What's he going to do, Norah?  For Christ's
sake, what is he going to do?'
</p>

<p>
She shook her head.  'I don't know,' she said.
</p>

<p>
He jumped at a sudden snap of a branch.  A
carrier had stepped on a dry twig.
</p>

<p>
'What was he saying to you?  I couldn't hear.'
</p>

<p>
'That he must be alone and think.'
</p>

<p>
Dick's voice went shrill.  'You say he's sitting
there, thinking in cold blood whether he'll let us
starve?'
</p>

<p>
She shrugged her shoulders.  She believed Archie
was doing more than that.  He was trying to save
something out of a wrecked universe.  If she had
not exaggerated the look in his eyes, he might even
be struggling for sanity.
</p>

<p>
Dick might be right that their fate swam in the
crucible, but she was so desolately unhappy it hardly
seemed to matter.  Dick's misery took a less stoical
form.
</p>

<p>
'It's awful,' he was saying, 'hanging about to hear
what he settles.  We might be criminals in the dock.
It's worse, for there the judge is not your enemy.'
</p>

<p>
Norah made no comment.  What was the good of
all this talk? ... and, well, she preferred Archie's
way of taking a knock.  Couldn't Dick spare her
this pitiful sight into his soul?  Was she cursed to
torture her husband and debase her lover?
</p>

<p>
'You don't seem to see, Norah,' he went on after
a glance over his shoulder, 'if he turns us off, we've
got food left for one day, for one day, till to-morrow.
Then three, four, or five days more we'll suffer the
tortures of starvation.  About Sunday we'll die.'  His
voice was out of his control.  'Die, do you
understand?'  He paused, and his fingers twisted
restlessly.  'By Tuesday, in a week's time, Norah, by
Tuesday we'll be rotten.  Don't you understand?'
</p>

<p>
'Always the little ray of sunshine,' said Norah.
</p>

<p>
His hands went up to his head.  'Oh! you must
think me a beast to say these things to you, but don't
you see, you must go to your husband and get him
to ... to stay.  He'll listen to you, if you beg him.
He can't have the heart.  Ask for time anyhow.
Plead with him.  If you must, promise him...'
</p>

<p>
'To go back?'  Her voice was hard.
</p>

<p>
Dick averted his eyes.  'Afterwards, things will be
different.  Anything may happen ... provided we
are alive.'
</p>

<p>
'Dick,' said Norah passionately, 'I may be a
rotter and a whore: d'you want to make me a
coward too?'
</p>

<p>
'But don't you see...'
</p>

<p>
'For Heaven's sake shut up; you're making me
hate you!'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Archie left his camp, he had wandered
aimlessly in the forest until he noticed a boulder,
and sat down.  Below him lay the lake as blue as
the Virgin's robe.  He could see the mountains of
the farther shore, their tops ruled straight by cloud.
They reminded him of Table Mountain and his
landing with Norah at Cape Town when hope was
high.
</p>

<p>
At his back towered the nearer lip of the crater.
Its height seemed to disparage his emotion.  How
long would this mortal and his ephemeral trouble
endure?  The bitterness, which had succeeded his
anger, passed and left him with a dazed sense of loss,
in which consecutive thought was stilled.  Pictures
of the happiness, turned so suddenly to dust, rose in
his mind:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Norah's tawny hair, rebellious under her nurse's
coif; Norah's slender hands opposite him at dinner
tinged by the shaded candlelight; the way she used
to throw herself into his arms when he came back
on leave; a fluffy sort of dressing-gown she once
had; and so on down the years of love and marriage
till the moment when he heard that ragtime tune
in the forest, whistled so gaily ... before she knew
he was there.
</p>

<p>
That hurt worst of all.  His mind ached into the
vast query&mdash;Why?  Why had he lost her?  He had
never understood how she came to love him, but
what had he done to make that miracle cease?  If
she had only told him!
</p>

<p>
Her outburst on the farm, which sent him hurrying
to the Congo, had come as a revelation.  Manlike,
he had assumed she liked the life she had chosen.
And all the time...
</p>

<p>
He felt no anger against Norah.  By some
illogical working of his love she seemed to stand
apart.  Though his mind recorded her infidelity and
reeled at it, his heart was filled with gracious
recollections of her.  What she was and had been, did not
seem to be obliterated by what she did and what was
done to her.
</p>

<p>
His hate focused blindingly on Dick Ward.
Imagination of that coarseness defiling his wife's
body drove the blood boiling to his brain, but he
never thought of her as defiled.  He was tormented
by the picture of Norah in Ward's arms, but she
was still Archie's Norah, not Dick's Norah,
unchanged ... only lost; stolen away like any
Eurydice.  He thought of her as of a dead woman
he had loved, still loved, would always love.
</p>

<p>
But the swine who had killed her&mdash;lust for his
blood mounted.  To shoot him in a duel, taking
inexorable aim after standing his fire....  To feel
the fat throat between his thumbs and to watch life
fading from protruding eyes and purpling face....
Human life was no great thing.  If the war had
not already shown him that, these years in the forest
had dwarfed the importance of mankind.  And his
standards had been warped by these last weeks spent
in the slaughter of monsters that take the three score
years and ten of man's span to reach the stature that
fits them for killing.
</p>

<p>
So for a while his mind played with the killing
of Dick Ward ... until the memory that already
the man's life was in his hands stayed him.  In his
pain he had lost sight of the crisis that before his
appearance had faced Ward and Norah.  He saw
that he had only to stand aside and execution would
be done.  Or rather, since no harm must come to
Norah, take her on alone with him, regaining his
wife and obliterating her lover.
</p>

<p>
But all the time he saw the impossibility.  He
could not leave a man to die whom he had promised
to help.  Still less could he kill him.  In a way
Ward was his guest; he had come to Archie without
food, or hope.  His defencelessness protected him.
And the duty that one white man in the wilds owes
another, backed by the African tradition of help and
hospitality, demanded his rescue.
</p>

<p>
Dick's helplessness, had he known it, was his
strength.
</p>

<p>
So what Archie would have called 'being decent'
prevailed, and, painfully, he began to plan the
immediate future.  He welcomed, indeed, anything
that held his mind away from thought of his loss,
the three lives.
</p>

<p>
The outcome of that salvation&mdash;what would
afterwards become of Norah, Ward, and
himself&mdash;he did not attempt to guess.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At last his ideas were in order.  In spite of the
heat he shivered as he got up to return to camp."

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
The first face he saw was Dick's.  In spite of
the heat through canvas, Norah had retired
into the tent.  Archie wondered if it was to show
she had not sent for Ward.  'Damn the fellow,' he
muttered, 'can't he see he's asking for trouble.'
</p>

<p>
That wouldn't do, he reflected; in a minute he'd
be at the man's throat.  Must be normal; what was
it Norah had said&mdash;'Be civilised'?
</p>

<p>
His attempt at normality and civility would have
made an angel laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Rain's coming,' he growled.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' replied Dick, and wondered whether this
was the small talk of the tribunal before the black
cap is assumed, 'that's why it's so appallingly hot,
I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
Archie stared at him inimically.  Dick's face was
wet with sweat and his silk shirt stuck to his body.
'Heat or funk?' thought Archie uncharitably.  But
the limpness of the leaves and the attentions of the
flies told him how hot it really was.  And yet he
was shivering.  Fever coming, he concluded.
Damned nuisance just now.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' he said aloud, 'the rains.'
</p>

<p>
He could stand the fellow's physical presence no
longer, and turned to the tent.
</p>

<p>
'Norah,' he said, 'we must make our plans....
I say, you oughtn't to be in this furnace.'
</p>

<p>
'I promised you...' she replied slowly.
</p>

<p>
He stared at her.  Then some promises were
binding!  That wouldn't do either.  If he was to go
through this show decently he must rule out bitterness
as well as anger.
</p>

<p>
They walked into the shade.  Dick followed.  His
restless eyes, his fingers twining and loosing revealed
his anxiety.  Archie felt the pervading suspense and
saw that for all his distaste for explanation he must
declare himself.  At last he broke the silence which
seemed so intolerable to Dick's tormented nerves.
His words were commonplace enough.
</p>

<p>
'This is a rotten position,' he said, and added, 'for
all of us,' then paused for thought.  'If we were
anywhere else,' he went on, 'I'd go away.  A long
way away, and let time'&mdash;he felt for a word&mdash;'mend
things.'  Another silence.  'Unless I called you out
and shot you'&mdash;his rapid whisper was more startling
than a shout.  'But, as it is, I can't clear out, or
you'd both starve.'
</p>

<p>
Dick wiped his forehead.
</p>

<p>
'So we've got to stick together,' ended Archie, 'till
we're out of this hole.'
</p>

<p>
Norah felt no relief.  Between them in their
several ways, these men made life more dreadful
than death.
</p>

<p>
Archie began again.  He was speaking now to
Dick, though his eyes looked beyond him.  'I make
one condition,' he said.  'I must have sole charge.
You must do what I say.  Otherwise I can't promise
to pull it off.'  He might have added that if Dick
was to oppose him at every turn he couldn't promise
restraint.  'Do you agree?' he asked curtly.
</p>

<p>
In his relief Dick would have agreed to change
his creed.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure you're right,' he said, 'unity of
command.'  The reprieve had gone to his head like wine,
and he talked light-headedly.  'By Jove, the heat!
I felt suffocated.'  But no whisper of a breeze had
come to dissipate the heaviness that lay on the land.
'What's your scheme to get away?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
Archie forced himself to answer.
</p>

<p>
'Move down to lake level first.'
</p>

<p>
'Why not go on up here?'
</p>

<p>
'Blast the man,' thought Archie.  Then aloud,
'How many days will it take us with Norah,' he
hesitated before mentioning her Christian name to
this fellow, 'to find a village?'
</p>

<p>
Dick spread out his hands.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I don't know either.  We might be out of
ammunition first.  And what about water?  And
where are we going to get carriers for your loads
from?'
</p>

<p>
Dick agreed brightly that by sticking to the lake
their water supply was assured.  It did not strike
him that in his relief his words were not very
profound.  The business of striking camp proceeded.
</p>

<p>
'You'll have my tent, Norah,' said Archie, and
gave Matao directions to have a shelter built for
him.
</p>

<p>
Dick's exhilaration vanished.  He opened his
mouth to speak, but a menace in Archie's eye
dissuaded him.  He kicked at a partly consumed log
and hummed gloomily.  Archie's withdrawal to pack
his kit at last gave him the opportunity to murmur
something to Norah about 'rubbing things in.'
</p>

<p>
'Do you expect me to sleep with you under my
husband's eyes?' she asked.  'Aren't you a trifle
<i>exigeant</i>?  Besides,' she added bitterly, 'you told
me just now to make up to him.'
</p>

<p>
His retort was prevented by footsteps behind
him.  He turned and saw that he was being offered a
couple of cartridges.
</p>

<p>
'Two rounds of 7.9 stuff I brought by accident.'
Archie explained.  'Found them in my kit.  They'll
fit your Mauser.'
</p>

<p>
When the loads were ready, the string of carriers,
with Changalilo at their head, straggled down the
hill.  The three Europeans, after a visible hesitation,
followed.  If their mutual company was unendurable,
to descend singly at intervals would be
grotesque.  So these two men and their woman, the
prey of all the forces that civilisation works to
repress, hatred, love, fear, shame, pity, danger, were
constrained by their sense of&mdash;was it humour or
reticence?&mdash;to observe the usages of daily intercourse.
</p>

<p>
They passed the foot of the blow-hole chimney
where Norah had sighted Changalilo the night
before, and the view that was revealed gave them a
momentary relief from the pain of thought.
</p>

<p>
All the week the clouds that herald the rains had
packed closer and closer on the horizon, till now
they lay like a litter of discoloured wool.
</p>

<p>
Across the lake the mountain tops which had been
hidden in haze, stood out in the sun-bathed clarity
of a primitive painting.  Their crags and ravines,
diminutive in the distance, looked as if human fingers
had pinched and dinted them into the powder-green
relief of a plaster map.  Black against this green lay
the foothills in the shadow of the cloud bank.  The
foreground was blocked by the near headland,
heavily green with the green of English elms in
August.  Every tree that grew there was distinct,
and the grass at their feet.  At the water's edge
gleamed pillars of white rock.
</p>

<p>
'I wish the rains would come,' said Norah at the
end of a silence.  'I feel as if I were breathing hot
fluff.'
</p>

<p>
But with the weight on her heart she would hardly
have noticed the stifling heat, had she not dreaded
the working of that suffocation on the men's nerves.
As she glanced away from Archie's pale face she
tried to forget the tales of violence, murder, suicide
committed often on almost frivolous grounds in the
exasperation of the heat that heralds the rains.
</p>

<p>
Here at lake level, close to the equator, the
dagger of jealousy and despair hilt-deep in his brain,
might not Archie find suicide or murder the only
solution?
</p>

<p>
It was agony to be so impotent to avert the doom
that hung over the two men she had loved and
crucified.  She felt, or imagined, their hot, angry
eyes on her, and dared not look up lest she loosed the
lightning.  She alone could lay the passions she had
so heedlessly aroused; and any word, any gesture
almost, might precipitate the latent madness.
</p>

<p>
She was aware that the strain of the intolerable
position could not endure; unless she lessened it
something would snap.  And the life of one or both
of the men would pay.  When death from starvation
had threatened, she had pictured herself in a short
dark corridor of days.  In front stretched an iron-grey
screen like a fireproof curtain.  Behind it lay
... what?  Now danger of death had lifted, and
still the screen was there.  Her mind was pinned to
the emergency of the moment, but even had that
urgent menace receded, she would not have dared to
lift the curtain.  What lay in store for her, she made
no attempt to divine.  Life with Dick, life with
Archie, life alone?  The future was too dreadful to
contemplate, the ruin she had wrought too radical.
And if&mdash;what she dreaded&mdash;took place, she would
be making plans for men who would be dead at
their fruition.
</p>

<p>
For the moment she anchored her conduct to the
only course that she felt could not do harm.  By a
manner resolutely matter of fact, she might create
a conventional atmosphere, might maintain the
dangerous equilibrium of the moment until the
impulse to violence died.
</p>

<p>
Archie, it seemed, when the vulture that tore at
his entrails would let him, had resolved on the same
conduct.
</p>

<p>
'What about resting here a bit?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'I don't believe it's much good.  It's as hot sitting
as walking.  What wouldn't I give for a breeze!'
</p>

<p>
'It may be days before it breaks,' said Archie.
'But if you're not tired the sooner we get down and
start work the better.'
</p>

<p>
'What are you meaning to do?' asked Dick aggressively.
</p>

<p>
By now he had lost his fear of Archie.  Enmity
and suspicion had taken its place.  He paid with
hatred for the panic that had gripped his heart,
for the doubts kindled in Norah's mind, for the
glamour stripped from him.  Where once he had
felt contemptuous pity, an uncertain jealousy
flickered.  He hated Archie because he held the
whiphand; he hated and despised him for not using
it.  He despised him that he might not despise
himself.  And he was uneasy.  Why had the man
promised to save him?  Why, above all things, had
he given him that ammunition?  Was there a trap?
</p>

<p>
He wished he had not agreed to Sinclair's leadership.
That condition, now he examined it, left the
way open to every treachery.  Was there a plot to
separate him from Norah and let him starve?...
</p>

<p>
With all her drastic methods, Africa seems to
have brought little out in Dick but a certain animal
cunning.  It was in a spirit of suspicious enmity
that he asked the question which opened the
discussion.
</p>

<p>
'What am I meaning to do?' repeated Archie.
He refrained from adding, 'What in hell's that to
you?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said Dick.
</p>

<p>
'Build a raft, if you want to know.'
</p>

<p>
'A raft?'
</p>

<p>
'Look here&mdash;&mdash;' said Archie, but Norah
intervened in time.
</p>

<p>
'To get over to the <i>Mimi</i>, Archie?'
</p>

<p>
'To get along the coast.'  Archie struggled with
his instinct to produce a completed job, discussing
it neither before nor after.  But his reasonable
nature told him that, where he gambled with the
lives of others, they had a right to see his play.
</p>

<p>
By now they had reached the camp by the ruins.
Under a stream of exhortation from Matao some of
the carriers had started to pitch Norah's tent;
others were cutting boughs for the shelter.
</p>

<p>
Norah led the way into the shade.  The men
followed.
</p>

<p>
'As far as I can see,' Archie began, 'there are
three ways out that aren't too risky.'
</p>

<p>
He stopped and looked up at the sky, which was
now heavy with cloud.  The heat, however, was
fiercer, as though a lid had been shut down on them.
</p>

<p>
'The weather matters too,' he explained.
</p>

<p>
'You were saying you had three plans,' said Dick.
</p>

<p>
Archie continued to address Norah.  He told her
that his first idea had been to stay where they
were and wait for rescue, relying on the game they
could shoot with the remaining ammunition, helped
out perhaps by fish from the lake.  The objection
to this simple plan was that the game would move
away and ammunition might be exhausted before
help came.
</p>

<p>
'Alibaba said twelve days,' put in Norah.
</p>

<p>
'Doubt it,' muttered Archie.  'One of the
Bulamatadi boats is in dry dock.  Or so they told me
at Songwe.  They mightn't be in a hurry to send.
Anyhow, it's a risk.'
</p>

<p>
There was a distant rumble of thunder.
</p>

<p>
'That may go on for weeks before anything
happens,' said Archie.
</p>

<p>
'Or,' he went on, 'we could ferry over to the
<i>Mimi</i>.  What you said.  I don't believe we'd be
any better off.  Any meat they could spare wouldn't
go far among all of us.  They'll have wasted half.
More likely we'll have to feed them.  And Ward's
ammunition&mdash;that'll have gone by now.  No native
can resist cartridges.'
</p>

<p>
Norah remembered what had looked like the
ammunition chest at the bottom of the disappearing
dinghy.  Its value would explain the Hindoo's
incorruptibility.  She expressed her conviction, and,
at the mention of the Indian, Dick broke into curses.
</p>

<p>
'The third way,' Archie began again, 'has got
the points of the other two.  If we made a couple
of rafts, we can tap the <i>Mimi</i> for anything in her
that's any use, and we can coast along the shore
with game and fish always handy.  Sooner or later
we must come to a fishing village.
</p>

<p>
'Danger,' he added, 'is squalls and crocs.'
</p>

<p>
Dick considered the scheme.  If there was a trap,
it was well hidden.
</p>

<p>
'It seems all right,' he admitted.
</p>

<p>
'That's most gratifying,' replied Archie, and
Norah reflected that the squalls which would follow
the coming of rain might be less dangerous than the
heat which came before it.
</p>

<p>
'We're wasting time,' said Archie, and calling
Matao he gave him his orders in Chi-wemba.
</p>

<p>
The hardwoods, he explained when he had
finished, Kayimbi, Mulombwa, Mubanga and the
rest, would not float.  But there was a little light
timber from which the natives cut their canoes.
</p>

<p>
'It's scattered about the hills,' he said.  'I'll
have to blaze it before we start felling'&mdash;but his
eyes showed his hesitation to leave his wife with
her lover.  She wondered what to do.  If she offered
to come, Dick might be stung to dangerous speech.
</p>

<p>
'I'll go and lie down,' she said.  'I've got a headache.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
An hour later, the apparently deserted hills
echoed with the resonant chopping of axes.  A dozen
wooden bells seemed scattered in the forest as the
tall trunks sounded with a rhythmic <i>clop! clop!</i>
under the soft native iron.  A rending, splitting
noise, and the first tree, with the swish of a gigantic
broom, tore through the boughs, prostrating its
neighbours.  The wooden bells clanked on as its
limbs were hacked from it.
</p>

<p>
Soon Norah found the heat of the tent unbearable.
She wandered to the shore, where she hoped a
breeze might be perceptible.  But the water was
as smooth as a mirror.  She faced inland.  A tree
top taller than the rest caught her eye.  It stirred.
The wind must be rising, although her wet face
felt no breath.  The tree trembled now.  Its boughs
waved, although wind seemed no more than a
memory of the dead.  The tree swayed.  A modulated
sway that lengthened with each period, until
with a splintering crash it submerged beneath the
ripple of the surrounding leaves.  It was man's work
she saw, not the wind's.
</p>

<p>
A native issued from the dark line of the forest.
The light caught the tawny bundle he carried.
Approaching the lake, he tossed a small log into the
water that the splash might scare any crocodile
which lurked there; then he bent and pushed the
tangles of lushishi, broad strips of flexible bark, into
the silvery margin.  He hooked his axe over his
naked shoulder and went off in search of more.
To-morrow, Norah knew, the sodden lushishi would
be twisted into rough ropes to lash the raft.
</p>

<p>
She pictured the adventure of the raft and
shrank from the heavy hours that awaited the three
of them cramped side by side on that narrow platform.
</p>

<p>
Archie had said 'two rafts,' but one would carry
the loads and the carriers who were not needed to
paddle their masters.  It was a pity a sense of the
ridiculous did not allow one raft to each European.
Jealousy, shame, hatred demand more footage than
a raft can give.  All the world may be too little.
</p>

<p>
But she was glad Archie had not decided to wait
in the bay.  Her instinct that tragedy pervaded the
deserted settlement had had foundation.  It now
urged escape before tragedy deepened.
</p>

<p>
She heard a European tread on the shingle and
turned to find Archie.
</p>

<p>
That's started,' he said.  'I'll ask Ward to keep
an eye on them while I try to get a buck.'  Determined
to pursue any indifferent topic, she asked
what sort of game he expected to find.
</p>

<p>
'Might be anything.  But I must keep on till
I find something big and fairly eatable.  Dwyka
or klipspringer are too small to be worth a cartridge,
while zebra or waterbuck ... I tried eating zebra
the other day!"
</p>

<p>
She sympathised.  There was a pause; both felt
awkward.
</p>

<p>
'I've told off a man,' pursued Archie resolutely,
'to make snares and things.  Though I don't believe
they ever catch much in them.  Those drop traps
are the best.  A beam poised over a gap in a bit of
fence.  We might get some small stuff that way&mdash;a
katiri or even a bush pig.  Doubt it, though.'
</p>

<p>
'Fish?' said Norah, remembering her efforts of
the day before.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, that's what I wanted to ask you.  I've
told Matao to find some one with ideas; when he
comes will you keep an eye on him?'
</p>

<p>
'They're all Awemba, I suppose?'  She knew
that that once warlike people had no water-lore.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, and Matao was shocked when I told him
to find one with an Awisa[<a id="chap0204fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0204fn1">1</a>] mother.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0204fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0204fn1text">1</a>] The Awisa, with a certain knowledge of the simpler arts of
peace, were conquered and swamped by the purely predatory
Awemba.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
After a moment of hesitation Archie left her.
She saw him speak to Dick, then with his gun under
his arm he disappeared into the trees.
</p>

<p>
As she watched him go, she could not restrain
a feeling of admiration.  In days past she had jibbed
at his thoroughness.  She saw its value now.  The
practical man might not cut a romantic figure; but
for coping with romantic situations, he could give
a stone to any Lohengrin or Lancelot.  His cautious,
deliberate nature, how it used to irritate her!  How
irresolute she had often thought him!  But now
she sighed for a little less resolution in his handling
of Dick.  Only the deliberate humour she had once
despised could avert tragedy.  But how formidable
the forces against its return!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap0205"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V
</h3>

<p>
Two or three big drops of rain fell.  Norah
made her way slowly back to camp.  Near
the ruins she was stopped by Dick, already tired of
watching the woodcutters.  She noticed that access
to his shaving tackle had restored his freshness.
</p>

<p>
'Norah,' he said, with his hint of a brogue, 'why
have you been keeping away from me all day, the
day I needed you most?'
</p>

<p>
Norah, never less inclined for sentiment, found
two answers ready to her lips; the first, that any
attention to him might set Archie at his throat, too
melodramatic; the second, that in his present mood
he was best left alone, too brutal.  So she remained
silent.
</p>

<p>
'What was Sinclair saying to you on the beach?'
he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Nothing much.  Being decent.'
</p>

<p>
Dick's face darkened.
</p>

<p>
'You mean I'm not?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, the way you come to me the moment his
back's turned, makes me look pretty cheap,' she
said dispassionately.
</p>

<p>
'How can I talk to you before him?  Be fair,
Norah.'
</p>

<p>
'Is there anything to talk about?' she asked.
'Isn't all as bad as we can make it without more
talk?'
</p>

<p>
'All right,' said Dick, 'I'll go back to the
wood-cutting.  If you'd rather talk to Sinclair...'
</p>

<p>
'Oh!  Dick,' she cried.  'Don't let's quarrel.  It's
horrible enough, without that!'
</p>

<p>
'Our love's horrible?'
</p>

<p>
'I didn't mean that.  The world's horrible; life's
ugly, cruel.  I thought I was finding something
beautiful, and all I've done is to hurt, betray,
spoil....'
</p>

<p>
Dick's jealousy boiled over.
</p>

<p>
'What makes you suddenly so careful of Sinclair's
feelings?' he asked.  'He had his chance of you.
He wasn't man enough to keep you.'
</p>

<p>
Norah was silent.  Why couldn't Dick shut up?
</p>

<p>
'But he's trying to get you back.  I know it.'
</p>

<p>
'You think he'd take me back?' she asked the
question half bitterly, half soberly, and for a
moment she fingered the sheet, draping a future that
lay as imperturbable as a corpse.
</p>

<p>
'Do you want him to?' said Dick violently.  'I'd
rather see you dead first.'
</p>

<p>
'It isn't on the cards,' she stated quietly.  She
had no clear idea of her own hopes, let alone
Archie's intentions.  She said as much to Dick.
He caught up her words.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, what's he up to, Norah?'  Dick's voice was
eager.  'What's his game?  Hasn't he given any
idea?'
</p>

<p>
'Has he any "game"?' she asked wearily.  'Unless
fighting with beasts in your heart is a game.'
</p>

<p>
'Why did he give me those cartridges?' persisted
Dick.  'He wasn't keen on me touching his ammunition
last night!' he added with a laugh, and made
Norah the confidante of his nocturnal adventure.
</p>

<p>
As a word, or a tune, or a scent may fire a train
of latent memory and illumine or connect experiences
till then dark and unrelated, so Dick's story
threw across his actions a beam as unsparing as the
blue glare of some great arc light in a main street
that midnight, rain, and frost had emptied.
</p>

<p>
Memories crossed her mind like pictures on a
screen.  Again Dick humbled himself on the shore
of the lake, and again she heard the paddles splash
as the Hindoo disappeared across the water.  She
saw Dick's helpless stare as he sat limply on the
pile of baggage contemplating the disaster he had
provoked and was impotent to stem.  She felt him
tugging at her sleeves in naked terror of Archie's
decision in the hills.  His breath was warm on her
face, urging her to beg the man they had wronged
for a few days' life.  She blushed with shame at
his advice to offer to go back, a promise, said he,
that need not be kept.
</p>

<p>
A dozen times he was convicted of meanness,
ingratitude, treachery.  She saw for a bungler and
a coward the man she had left all to follow.  The
man she had loved&mdash;that she still loved for all she
knew.  Feeling was dried out of her by pain and
anxiety, but her brain told her that, if ever the
crisis passed, she would find the image of Dick
still near her heart.
</p>

<p>
And Archie, while she could see each of his
virtues&mdash;pluck, loyalty, gentleness&mdash;written in
letters of fire, she knew that never again could he
quicken her pulses.
</p>

<p>
Hot scorn of herself and her lover filled her
veins, but she did not voice it.  All her wit was
devoted to the task of keeping the men from each
other's throats.  She scrutinised every word before
she spoke it, that nothing she said might send the
precarious triangle, at whose apex she stood, heeling
to disaster.
</p>

<p>
So while her realisation of Dick's unworth penetrated
her brain as lead is melted and poured into
a mould, she was guiding the conversation to soothe
his ruffled vanity: and not until she felt her end
attained did she leave him on the excuse that she
must see about the fishing.
</p>

<p>
On her way to the beach she was met by a note
from Archie asking her to send six men to carry in
a hartebeeste he had shot.  With a sigh of relief
she dismissed one anxiety.  There was food now for
all for a day or two.
</p>

<p>
It was dusk before the procession returned in
pairs, the dismembered limbs of the buck swinging
from freshly-cut poles that rested on their bowed
shoulders.  Anxious to regain the firelight before
dark, their knees were bent and their hips swung
in a gliding trot.  One arm supported the pole, the
other held a spear or axe.  Behind them walked
Archie with his gun over his shoulder.  He gave
orders for the meat to be spread on the ground
beside the fire and bade the tense, black circle stand
farther back.
</p>

<p>
'In this heat the stuff will be rotten by to-morrow
night,' he remarked.  'They won't mind,
though.'
</p>

<p>
He told Changalilo to take the saddle for the
European table, and watched while Matao with
an axe divided the rest between the natives.  They
knelt and clapped their hands in salutation before
they withdrew, clasping each man his sanguinary
portion.  Soon a ring of bright little fires half-burnt,
half-smoked the spitted meat, and the night
was full of soft voices and high-pitched laughter.
</p>

<p>
Archie subsided into a deck-chair and sat silent,
his head in his hands.  Nervous of his thoughts,
Norah inquired about the kill.
</p>

<p>
He had had to cover a lot of ground, he
answered, uttering his words carefully.  No, there
wasn't a herd; a solitary ram, turned out probably
for his bad temper; grazing behind an anthill.  He
was hoping she would not hear his teeth clattering
against each other.  Pains that started from the
base of his skull and shot across his head assured
him that an attack of malaria threatened.
</p>

<p>
With an effort he answered Norah, who, anxious
to cover Dick's silence, had asked another question.
</p>

<p>
'One round,' he said, 'heart shot.'
</p>

<p>
When at last dinner came he could not eat it.
As soon as the others had done, he withdrew to his
shelter.  Though she guessed he was ill, Norah did
not dare to follow, and after enduring Dick's sullen
monologue retired early to the tent Archie had
allotted her.  Body triumphed over mind, and she
slept as soon as she had stretched herself on her
bed.
</p>

<p>
In the early hours of the morning she woke.  She
was conscious at once, before thought returned, of
the oppression of impending disaster that had been
her waking burden.  Then she remembered.
</p>

<p>
Refreshed by sleep, her brain took up its round,
searching for the path that led to safety.  She saw
at last why that search had been futile.  Till now
she had not dared face the future, to imagine what
lay behind the curtain.  A flash of insight revealed
that she must pledge her future if she was to cope
with the present....  For a time she fought off
the question that clawed at her brain.  At last she
confronted it&mdash;'Must I give up Dick?' she asked
herself.
</p>

<p>
With reluctant clearness she saw that, if she gave
up her lover and told her husband, she would
sterilise the soil so fertile with violence.  But could
she pay the price of sacrifice and humiliation?
Could she let Dick go?  Though all passion was
buried under ashes, Dick was still a part of her
subconscious life.  She could not at once uproot
the vivid memories of their few weeks together.
Her emotions were in a state of suspended animation,
shut off, not dead.  What needs might not
arise in that future she shrank from visualising!
</p>

<p>
Moreover, Dick loved her.  Must he pay the price
as well?  Must she go on racking the men who loved
her and inflict on Dick the anguish Archie seemed
to suffer?
</p>

<p>
When she was sinking into a morass of conflicting
emotion, pride came to her help.  Whatever else
she felt for Dick, she knew that she despised him.
Contempt makes an ill bedfellow.  A woman can
love a weak man whom she pities; she is too practical
to trust her life to a man she despises.
</p>

<p>
Almost against her will, Norah's mood hardened.
The tent stifled her.  She must make this cruel
decision in the open air.  Slipping into a cloak, she
stepped into the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
The natives, less black than their shadows, slept
in contorted postures about the ground.  Here was
an arm flung out, as if a declamatory gesture had
beep stilled in sleep; there was a knee drawn up as
if pain had found cessation in death.  The ruined
tower threw its shadow across the sleepers, a shadow
which seemed to Norah the visible presentation of
the doom she had divined.
</p>

<p>
In the distance a hyæna howled like a ship's syren
and reminded her that it was not safe to move beyond
the arc of light flung by the fire.  As she took
the chair Dick had left, she was startled by a voice
she did not recognise.  She could distinguish no
words.  Quietly she picked her way between the
sleeping bodies to the shelter where Archie lay.  The
moonlight fell in flecks between the leaves, and she
could see Archie sprawling on his back, nearly naked,
his lips muttering in fever.  As she picked up the
clothes her arm brushed against him.  He caught
at it with hot, dry hands.  A string of curses poured
from his unconscious lips as he gripped her wrist
with his two hands, digging his thumbs into her flesh.
The pressure was so painful she felt she must wake
him, but with a final twist under which her skin
tore, he let go.
</p>

<p>
'You won't touch her again,' he muttered.
'Damn you, not ever again!'
</p>

<p>
She pulled the clothes on to the bed and tucked
them in, then fetched another blanket from her
tent and spread it over him, that he might sweat
out the fever.  He had enough to endure without
that.
</p>

<p>
She bathed her arm and sat down, her hesitation
gone.  The manner of Archie's dreaming proved
that her fears were not imaginary.  It lay with her
that dreams did not pass into deeds.
</p>

<p>
Nor could she leave Archie to fight his fever
alone; but until she had made clear her position
between the two men, it was not possible for her
to take up her duty by her husband's sick-bed.
As another man's acting mistress she had no right
there.  The sight of her might even make him
worse.
</p>

<p>
She would not feel clean till she had humbled
herself before Archie, told him she renounced Dick,
and offered to fulfil the contract she had vowed
and broken.  Archie might well refuse the spoiled
remnants of her loyalty, but she would at least have
done the little she could to repair the irreparable
wrong.  And Dick ... she did not dare to think of
Dick.  Before she spoke to Archie she must tell Dick.
He had a right to hear from her lips.  She had to
tell him that their love must end ... was ended.
She would have to launch upon a hopeless explanation
of motives she barely understood and reasons
which he would refuse.  Every shred of reticence
would be torn to tatters.  Agonised but inflexible,
she would have to listen to his reproaches,
arguments, prayers.
</p>

<p>
Could she trust her will under that fire?  Would
she not be wiser to tell Archie before she told Dick?
Once she had offered to her husband the remainder
of her burnt-out life, honour would keep her weak
flesh from yielding to her lover's entreaties.
</p>

<p>
Nor was that all.  Dick jilted, his love and
vanity ableed, would be in the mood to provoke
Archie, not yet aware of his wife's renunciation, to
fatal action; and the tragedy she had given her
love to avert would be consummated in a death
grapple between the two men she had loved and
left.
</p>

<p>
Before she fell asleep again, her mind was made
up that first Archie must hear she had given up
Dick for ever.  Then Dick must be told."

<h3>
CHAPTER VI
</h3>

<p>
As soon as it was light, Norah was awakened
by Archie's voice outside her tent.  He was
speaking in Chiwemba, and she could hear Matao's
monosyllabic replies.
</p>

<p>
Her call brought Archie to the doorway.  She
resisted an impulse to tell him to come in; he seemed
so infinitely remote.
</p>

<p>
'You ought to be in bed,' she told him.
</p>

<p>
He assured her that he was better.
</p>

<p>
'What is it?  Fever?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.  But it's down this morning.'
</p>

<p>
If he had not been standing with his back to the
light, she could have seen from the colour of his
eyes that it was not very far 'down.'
</p>

<p>
'You ought to have a day in bed and give
yourself a chance,' she urged him.
</p>

<p>
'Can't.  Every moment brings the rains nearer.
No joke to be caught on a raft by a squall.'
</p>

<p>
She asked if the natives could not be left to work
alone, or, she hesitated a moment, under Dick's
charge.
</p>

<p>
He answered that every time he'd ever left a
native to himself he'd regretted it.  And this was
too important.  He couldn't be relied on to get a
buck with every round and not a day must be
wasted.  Ward, he said evenly, was in bed.
</p>

<p>
'You're an obstinate Scot, Archie,' she said with
a little sigh.  'You must go your own way.'
</p>

<p>
'Afraid so,' he replied, with an effort at a smile.
Then in a gentler tone than he had used since she'd
met him in the hills, 'Thank you, it's nice of you
to have bothered.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Archie, she thought, he was grateful for
little enough.
</p>

<p>
He talked for a moment about the work.  That
day the felled and trimmed logs must be manhandled
to the water's edge.  There were too few
natives for the size of the trees.  They would be
hauling from hillside to lake all day.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, she reproached herself for not acting
up to the night's resolve.  But she could not take
the plunge, lying in bed with Archie stiff and
awkward in the doorway, held from his work by
courtesy alone.  She would do better in the forest,
she assured herself.
</p>

<p>
But it is not the easiest thing in the world for
a proud woman to offer herself to a man who may
no longer want her, and she lingered on in bed as
long as her self-respect would let her.  Then she
dressed slowly.  For a time she stood staring at
the lake, which lay under the storm clouds grey as
a salmon's scales.  It was under a week, as calendars
measure time, since she had first set eyes on the lake,
welcoming it as the friend that pointed the way
to Europe and happiness.
</p>

<p>
Well, she knew Tanganyika better now.
</p>

<p>
She turned her back on the lake and on the hopes
it had once aroused.  She would not see Europe,
perhaps, until she was an old woman.  The interview
she was on her way to seek would, she supposed,
make fast the bonds that stretched her on the altar
of Africa.
</p>

<p>
She found Archie sitting on the wreck of a tree
felled by the tireless destructiveness of white ants.
She noticed how fever and pain had hollowed his
face and bleached it under the sunburn, till it
stared like a Cubist sculpture.  The natives
clustered in groups, chattering while Matao hacked a
grip in the fifteen-foot log that lay at his feet, to
attach the lushishi ropes.
</p>

<p>
'That will do,' said Archie, 'get on with it.'
</p>

<p>
The ropes were fastened and the gang split into
two rows.  Matao raised his voice in falsetto song
and the deeper voices of the workers joined the
chanty.  At the first beat of each bar they hauled
on the ropes, shuffling their feet in a bear-like
measure to the unstressed beats, so that the log
progressed by jerks.
</p>

<p>
'No good showing them how to pull like men
instead of the Russian ballet,' said Archie.  'The
Wemba have hauled trees that way since they came
out of the West and they're going on.'
</p>

<p>
'To the same tune too,' added Norah.
</p>

<p>
'Probably/.  Then, after a pause, 'Anything up?'
</p>

<p>
She reassured him.
</p>

<p>
'Then I think I'll keep with them and see they
don't slack.'
</p>

<p>
With an effort of will she stopped him.  'Please,
Archie....  Can't we talk?  There's something
I've got to say.'
</p>

<p>
He looked distressed.  'Need we?' he muttered.
'Isn't it better left alone?'  Without awaiting her
answer, he moved in the direction of the singing.
</p>

<p>
She stood firm.  'No, Archie, I must.  You can
go back to the work in a minute.'
</p>

<p>
He shouted for Matao.  The singing ceased, while
he ran to receive his orders.  His return was
signalled by a fresh outburst of the tune.  Norah
wished for a moment she had let Archie go.  The
start was intolerable.  To gain time she asked how
he had got his fever.  He told her it was fording
a river one day after elephant.  She expressed her
surprise.  This was the first she had heard of
elephant hunting.
</p>

<p>
He told her the size of his bag and the weight of
the ivory.  'Not that it matters now,' he added,
in spite of himself.
</p>

<p>
'D'you know, Archie,' she said, 'you never told
me a word?'
</p>

<p>
He stared at her in silence.  'Nor I did,' he
answered at last.  'But that was half the reason
I went to the Congo.'
</p>

<p>
'And the other, the pure-bred bull,' she said sadly.
</p>

<p>
'Bull?' he was obviously puzzled, 'what bull?'
</p>

<p>
A measure of their old familiarity returned to her.
'Archie,' she said, 'you're maddening.  Do you
realise I haven't a notion what you've been doing
from the day you left the farm till ... till we
met here?'
</p>

<p>
So Archie struggled with his taciturnity and,
helped out by Norah's questions, produced a more
or less coherent story.
</p>

<p>
Until Norah's outburst on that momentous evening
at the farm, no intuition had warned him she
hated the life they were living.  Intuition,
introspection, and so forth don't get the same scope with a
pioneer working eleven hours a day on a ranch, as
they do with a serious young man fulfilling himself
in Chelsea.  Archie's only excuse took the form of a
tribute to Norah.
</p>

<p>
'You stuck it like a brick,' he said.  'You never
gave a sign.'
</p>

<p>
'I'd have been pretty mean if I had,' she put in.
'I made you come out here.'
</p>

<p>
So when at last her restraint had snapped, he
treated the revelation with even more than his
normal solemnity.  After his habit he looked at the
issue from both sides.  For his part, the life and
the country were ideal.  And he was, he believed,
on the slow gradient that leads his kind of man to
success.  But then Norah, she told him, hated the
farm, the forest, everything.  And the issue she did
not believe worth waiting for.
</p>

<p>
Archie thought too clearly to assume the right
of any one, even an Englishman, to impose his
wishes on a fellow man; so it did not occur to him
that he might keep Norah in surroundings she
disliked.  At the same time his deep-seated, if
unvocal, love for Norah turned down the solution that
she should go back to England, while he stayed
and worked the farm.  The nearest he could now
bring himself towards some expression of this was to
murmur, 'I didn't think then I could do without
you'&mdash;words which added remorse to the pity in
Norah's breast.
</p>

<p>
His logical brain accepted the only choice that
remained&mdash;to take Norah back to England and
find work there.
</p>

<p>
Once he had decided, it was not his way to
brood on the cost of abandoning the farm that had
absorbed two years and over of his life.  He chose
without murmuring the lesser of the evils that
confronted him.  Many days would have followed of
slow consideration of plans to realise his assets, had
not the pace been forced by no less humble an instrument
of Providence than 'Mr. Jones of the Congo.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'That night at dinner,' explained Archie, 'I said
I was thinking of selling the herd.  Jones' eyes lit
up and he told me he had a pal on the Katanga
who'd buy them.'
</p>

<p>
Archie had not been greatly impressed until he
learnt that Jones' friend was head compound
manager of a group of mines.  The contract for the
miners' meat was in his hands.
</p>

<p>
'If you let me handle the deal,' Jones had said,
'I'll get you a better price for "live weight" than
you'll get anywhere else for "dead."'
</p>

<p>
'Bribery all round,' said Archie to himself, 'but
that's not my concern.'
</p>

<p>
'You've been good to me,' added the "stiff,"
'I'll only take five per cent. on the transaction.'
</p>

<p>
This Archie, with his Scotch blood, thought excessive;
Jones himself must have had some qualms,
since he was willing to throw in a bit of information
that might, he said, make Archie's fortune.
</p>

<p>
I've been offered that sort of tip before,' said
Archie, 'and I wanted to know a bit more.'
</p>

<p>
Well, it wasn't an undiscovered gold field or pipe
of diamonds, but the whereabouts of what Jones
described as 'the elephants' home town.'
</p>

<p>
The year before he had stumbled on a little-known
valley on the Congo side of Lake Tanganyika
where elephant, he declared, were as thick as rabbits
and as big as dinosaurs.  Tusks up to 150 lbs.
</p>

<p>
'Not unnaturally I asked him why he didn't
take a knock at them himself,' said Archie.  'But
he had a yarn ready that he had lost his nerve for
elephant.'
</p>

<p>
Well, to cut a long story short, Archie did not
believe a word until Jones drew him a sort of map
of the locality, marking the position of several
villages.  The name of one of the villages was
familiar.  Searching his brain, Archie remembered
that he had that day written on a Congo native
for mason's work, who gave that village as his
home.
</p>

<p>
'More to score off Jones than because I believed
there was anything in it, I sent for Wadia,' he
told Norah.  'To my surprise he confirmed his story.
Elephant, he said, were as plentiful there as the
puku on our flats: their footprints were as long
across as his arm.'
</p>

<p>
In the light of this support Archie's reply that
he would think it over was characteristic.  It did
not, however, suit Jones.  The D.C. at&mdash;he
mentioned the name&mdash;had given him a hint not to
stay too long in the country, and he must push on the
next day.  If Archie liked to come to Elizabethville
and give him five per cent. on the sales he secured,
well and good; if not, they'd leave it at that.
Archie, without answering, worked out the suggested
commission on the back of an envelope.  He found
that he stood to gain more than he gave.  Making
the further stipulation that the compound manager
paid hard cash, he professed willingness to start the
following morning.
</p>

<p>
'Right, it's a bargain,' said Jones.
</p>

<p>
Nora told Archie how she had overheard these
words.  'If only I'd heard it all!' she said.  'Why
on earth didn't you tell me, Archie?'
</p>

<p>
'Well, it seemed pretty wild.  The whole thing
might be a try on.  And I didn't want to talk about
it till I'd got the money and we could start home.'
</p>

<p>
But if, he said, she hadn't been asleep when he
came to say good-bye he'd have told her.  In fact
that's what he came to say.
</p>

<p>
Norah felt that the petty deception had been
the fatal moment of her life.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
He did not say much about his journey north.
Quite early he had decided there was no object in
accompanying Jones to Elizabethville and had made
straight for the Valley of Ivory, as he named it.
Sceptical to the last, Archie had to admit that the
place came within measurable distance of Jones'
enthusiasm.  Of his adventures there he gave no
account.
</p>

<p>
'You feel a bit of a swine the first elephant
you shoot,' he mentioned.  It's so big, so contemptuously
trustful.  You seem to have taken an unfair
advantage of a large-minded opponent.  And you've
destroyed something older and longer in the making
than yourself.  Like burning an old master.'
</p>

<p>
The first hitch had come after he had shot his
first two bulls.  That was the number allowed him
on his thousand franc license.  He applied at the
'Poste' for the second license he had been promised,
to be met with a bland refusal.  No second licenses
were being issued.  He had considered his position.
If he gave up the hunt, he would go back to Norah
with a hundred or a hundred and fifty more sovereigns
in his pocket.  Even with a first-rate sale of
his stock that wouldn't be much use.
</p>

<p>
The alternative was to stay and poach.
</p>

<p>
'Everybody does it up there,' was the excuse
he gave Norah.
</p>

<p>
But Archie never had cared for the example of
other people; the force which urged this law-abiding
Scot to break the law was his love for Norah.
Where she was concerned, he stuck at nothing.  He
had not hesitated to abandon his farm and two years'
work to satisfy what most men would call a fancy.
A Bulamatadi law did not stand much chance.  The
pity is that he was so careful to conceal from Norah
this one recklessness and its source.
</p>

<p>
Not that it was necessary to surcharge her cup.
He had said enough to show that while she flirted
with Dick his only thought had been her service.
</p>

<p>
But her last defence remained to be stormed.
</p>

<p>
'If only you had come when I sent,' was her cry.
</p>

<p>
Archie stared.
</p>

<p>
'The letter Jacketi brought,' she repeated.
</p>

<p>
'I never saw Jacketi,' he said slowly.
</p>

<p>
She told him of the despairing letter she had
sent, of Jacketi's return without an answer, and
of the days she had waited.
</p>

<p>
He dropped his hands hopelessly.
</p>

<p>
'Jacketi never came near me.  He must have
turned into some village for a beer-drink.'
</p>

<p>
'Damn him, damn him!' cried Norah, and then
in a dead voice, 'No, it's I who am damned.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The work gang returned trailing the lushishi
ropes.  Husband and wife stood silent while the
capitao prepared another log for hauling.
</p>

<p>
When the workers had danced themselves out
of sight, Archie saw that Norah was crying.  His
awkwardness returned.  'Don't cry,' he said, 'it's
done now; we can't help it.'  He searched his mind
for comforting phrases.
</p>

<p>
'I wouldn't have gone,' she said like a child, 'if
I'd known.'
</p>

<p>
What could he say?  Why had she insisted on
this useless laceration?
</p>

<p>
'I thought you didn't care,' she repeated again
and again.
</p>

<p>
He felt that this was unendurable.  All his energy
was needed for action.  Emotion might complete
the harm that fever had begun.  Norah too must
spare herself.  He took a tug at the strait waistcoat
of stoicism he had condemned himself to wear,
remarking dispassionately that he must go back to
the work.  Many more logs should have been
transported by now.
</p>

<p>
But Norah's weakness had been momentary, and
her courage reasserted itself.  'Wait!' she said, 'I
haven't told you what I came to say.'
</p>

<p>
How could she allude to what had happened
without hurting him?  How could she tell him it
was over without promising more than she could
perform?  The phrases formed in her mind.  She
rejected each in turn.
</p>

<p>
'I'm giving Dick up!'  That sounded as if she
grudged a sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
'Take me back!' held out hopes she could not
justify.
</p>

<p>
'I've left Dick'&mdash;she might be a kept woman.
</p>

<p>
'Archie,' she said slowly, 'I wanted to tell you
that I'm leaving Dick, whatever happens.  If you
want me still, I'll come back to the farm.'
</p>

<p>
Archie did not speak.  Not even his expression
altered.  The pain he had suffered had dulled his
senses.  His silence, his undecipherable features
spared Norah nothing of humiliation.  What was he
thinking of her?  Like a child she wondered if
any one was marking up her humiliation against
the harm she had done.  Her words rang in her ear.
She could not force herself to add a syllable to them,
though she saw how inadequate they were.  How
Archie must despise her!  Unfaithful even in
adultery.  Taking a man and leaving him in a few
weeks.  Like any harlot: less constant than the
animals, whose fidelity endures the breeding season.
</p>

<p>
In fact, Archie had no clear thoughts.  He felt
that waves were buffeting him: his bones ached with
fever: his brain was numb.  Like Norah, he had
turned his back to the future, and this fresh shuffling
of the bits of coloured glass that make the kaleidoscope
of life, as yet meant nothing to him.  He could
not focus his thinking.  Presently one thought
emerged.  Not a very lofty one.  'You've got her
back from Ward,' crooned his instinct of possession.
</p>

<p>
Then an idea flickered through his brain, stabbing
like a white-hot wire.
</p>

<p>
'Does this mean she still loves me?'
</p>

<p>
His body seemed to come to life and to flow with
young, clean blood.  He must sound the amazing
possibility at once and risk the pain that denial
would bring.
</p>

<p>
'Why are you ... what makes you give up
Ward?' he stammered.
</p>

<p>
Norah felt explanation beyond her powers.
Surely it was not demanded of her to tell how she
had come to despise and distrust her lover; and
how she had been driven to parry the danger she
sensed.
</p>

<p>
'I can't go on,' she answered simply.
</p>

<p>
But Archie's stoicism had deserted him, and he
found the suspense more atrocious than yesterday's
certitude.
</p>

<p>
'It wasn't because you thought you might...'  His
voice trailed away.
</p>

<p>
She understood what he wanted to ask, and
sorrowfully shook her head.  She dared not start
into a labyrinth of deception through which her feet
would have to drag every day of her life.
</p>

<p>
Archie's eyes, which had been alive with
incredulous hope, died.  He sat down heavily on the
stump, no longer sustained by any aspiration, hope
as dead and dry as bones in the sand.
</p>

<p>
'I had to tell you,' Norah murmured.
</p>

<p>
He nodded.
</p>

<p>
'Don't let's talk of it any more,' he said; 'we
needn't settle anything yet.'
</p>

<p>
For once he felt he must talk; the sound of his
voice was preferable to the bottomless vacancy of
his heart.
</p>

<p>
'We've got to get out of here first.  Then I dare
say you'll like to be taken back to England.  Then
we can see.'
</p>

<p>
In his disappointment he clutched at her offer of
reconciliation.  It was something to know that she
was not a total loss to him.  He had, it seemed,
only to say the word and she would come back into
his life.  If he did not set his demands on happiness
too high something might be saved out of the wreck.
</p>

<p>
Norah had been watching his face.  Her heart
had ached for him as she saw the re-birth of hope
and its deception.  She had been tempted to foster
it; but why treat him like a child when his
manliness made him so admirable?  She had lost
confidence in herself and felt she blundered in a dark
room, bruising and crushing against her will.
</p>

<p>
She was distressed to see how ill and worn he
looked now that hope had left him.  Finding no
word that could help, she urged him to come to
his breakfast.  To her surprise he consented.
Together they started downhill.  Archie stumbled.  In
his disappointment, the fever was mastering him.
He stumbled again.  Norah took his arm and led
him to camp.  With Changalilo's help she put him
to bed.  He seemed affected by her care for him.
It gave him the momentary illusion that nothing had
happened and that their life together had not been
interrupted except perhaps by a night's dreaming.
Hugging the illusion, he fell asleep.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Towards evening the slanting rays of the sun
entered his shelter and woke him.
</p>

<p>
Two facts permeated his waking consciousness&mdash;a
body sore in every bone and a mind that grappled
with the possibilities of Norah's offer to come back
to him&mdash;'if he wanted her.'  How he wanted her!
Was there anything else he wanted?
</p>

<p>
But ever his reason forbade him to listen to his
affections.  Whenever he smothered his common
sense, retribution followed.  Of course it had been
mad to think he could make a husband for Norah,
and it was mad to think he could hold her now....
But as yet nothing need be determined.  His
first job was to get them out of this ... but there
was something that had to be done at once.  What
was it? ... Damn this fever....  Oh, yes!
Johnny, the fundi, had reported a herd of eland in
the hills behind the ruins.  With the rains coming,
they would not stay there.  He must get one that
evening and have the meat dried into strips, as a
stand-by on the rafts.
</p>

<p>
Painfully he lifted himself out of bed and, his
head swimming with weakness, got into his clothes.
How heavy his .420 weighed!  Pity the handy little
.303 had been smashed up by that wounded bull!
A near shave it had been!
</p>

<p>
He looked about for a native to carry his gun,
but the camp was empty.  Resting the heavy rifle
on his shrinking shoulder, he walked shakily into
the hills.
</p>

<p>
He looked up at the sun and saw that in under
two hours it would be dark.  There was not much
time.  As he walked he searched the ground for
spoor.  Padded footprints on a stretch of sand
showed where one of the smaller cats had stepped
in the night.  A genet probably; too small for a
serval.  Norah had had a tame genet on the farm.
'Fred' it had been called.  He remembered the little
blind thing he had bought for a shilling from a
native who would have eaten it.  It used to sleep
all day in Norah's pocket; she had nursed it through
infancy, waking in the night to feed it on warm
milk and water, but it had died while still a kitten,
bitten by a native dog.
</p>

<p>
Norah had always a liking for the little wild
things of the forest; some feeling of kinship,
maybe....
</p>

<p>
His eye rested on the delicate footprints of a
dwyka.  The antelope's bound had impressed its
hard, slender toes into the baked earth.  The
tracks were a day old ... was it thinkable that
Norah and he would be able to take up their life
together from the point where she had dropped it?
Would memory let them?  Was this ... adventure
of Norah's a mere episode that they could both
forget or did it mean more?...
</p>

<p>
He'd thought there were leopards about and
those scratches on the bark of that muputa tree
showed where a leopard had sharpened his claws.
Leopardess, more likely, to judge by the height....
It was too rocky ahead, he would have to work
round behind the mission.  There wasn't a breath of
wind, so it didn't matter which way he came at the
game....
</p>

<p>
Here were the ruins, the sweep of the hill had
brought him out too low.  Funny how Norah hated
the place&mdash;fancy, of course.  Was that her voice
he heard?  But quinine makes your ears sing and
then you imagine voices.  Still those deep tones of
Norah's....  He'd just look round the tower to
see if any chance had brought her there.  She'd be
angry with him for leaving bed....
</p>

<p>
He rounded the ruined tower and stood as if
paralysed by what he saw.  His right knee bent
to advance began to tremble violently with slow,
separated jerks.  He tried to raise his voice, but
his lips had gone dry.  They felt swollen.  He had
not had this feeling since the nightmares of his
childhood when he had seemed to cower in a
small dark room, gasping for air, while a shapeless,
colourless, nameless body like a distorted
featherbed or an obscene grand piano was swelling, swelling
and crushing him out of existence.  The oncoming
of absolute and inevitable disaster.
</p>

<p>
So he stood, while not twenty yards from his
eyes, Norah's body lay fast held in Ward's arms.
His kisses rained on her white face.  Her tired eyes
were shut&mdash;he imagined the little blue veins in
their lids&mdash;and she seemed to swoon with pleasure.
</p>

<p>
In spite of the resolution he had taken in the hills,
at moments Archie's rage against Dick had rowelled
him.  Imagination had goaded him with intolerable
pictures of his wife's intimacy with her lover,
kissing, for instance, body to body, Dick's rather full
lips crushed into her carmine mouth.  The vision
always lashed him to a mute fury in which he
could feel his rival's throat bulge under his fingers.
Fever had given body to these visions and had
reduced his self-control.  But except perhaps in
dreams, such as Norah had witnessed, the crisis was
momentary and quickly overcome.
</p>

<p>
When, therefore, a few yards off, he saw his
wife's pale face forced back by the weight of her
lover's kiss, her little body crushed by the violence
of his arms, the familiar process was started.  Rage
blazed up to be as instantly curbed by will.  Fiercely
he commanded his passion, until realisation dawned.
This was no unhealthy, torturing fancy, but an
enactment in flesh and blood.  And if the picture
before him was real, so was that throat real.  At any
rate the weight of the gun on his shoulder was real.
But where did imagination start and reality end?
Had he imagined Norah promising him that
morning to give up Ward and, if he said the word, come
back to him?  No, that was real.  Then this picture
that seemed to sear his eyes must be the work of
fever in his brain.  Norah did not lie.  And she had
promised ... he then must be mad.  Fever was
not enough to cast shadows so solid as those before
his eyes....  Fact or fancy, he'd stop it, by God!
</p>

<p>
He humped up his shoulder, and the barrel of
the rifle fell into his left palm.  The familiar feel
of the metal cleared his mind.  Those were real
people over there, Dick Ward and Norah Sinclair;
real, mortal, vulnerable people.  And Norah had
lied to him that morning; had come to him with
her flesh a-tingle perhaps from Ward's kisses, and
had lied to make Ward safe.  Well, she shouldn't
get away with the lie.  Hot fury blazed in Archie's
breast, and power of motion returned.
</p>

<p>
He must have shouted, though he did not hear
his voice; a startled face turned towards him, and
slowly, oh! slowly, Norah's eyes opened.
</p>

<p>
He saw his enemy drop Norah, start to his feet,
snatch at a gun that lay on the ground.  With his
right thumb Archie pushed over his safety catch,
and for an instant the barrel rested on Norah.  She
had been fooling him all the time, perhaps all these
years she had fooled him....  Then the sights
swung round and aligned on Dick.  Some one should
pay him for this.
</p>

<p>
Before Ward could raise his rifle from hip to
shoulder, a shot rang through the ruins.  His knees
sagged, bent; then he toppled over with his face
rubbing the ground.  His shoulders twitched and
his hands opened and clenched.  A jerk, and he had
twisted on to his back.  Thus he lay staring at the
sky, and the tissue of enterprise and weakness,
frailty and charm that had been Dick Ward ceased
to exist."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII
</h3>

<p>
When Dick had fallen, for a perceptible
time his murderer stood without motion,
without thought, the noise of the shot ringing in his
ears.  Norah, he noticed at last, was kneeling beside
the body, fumbling with its collar.  He remarked
her skirt was in a pool of dark blood.  She would
not, he reflected, be able to wear that dress again.
</p>

<p>
He started to go to her, stopped, and stood in
thought.  If he went to her he would hear her
reproaches, see her grief, perhaps be maddened to
... harm her.  He knew he would be sorry later
if he did.  Nothing in the world would make him
sorry about Ward.
</p>

<p>
Without any conscious act of will he walked away
into the forest.  As he walked he held at arm's
length the knowledge of Norah's treachery.  That
had better not be faced till his head was calm again.
Thinking about Ward did not matter.
</p>

<p>
His anger had vanished, but nothing like remorse
took its place.  His mind handled the crime
dispassionately, mathematically.  Before his
... action he had, he now saw, been trying to solve an
insoluble problem.  The world had been veiled in
a thick fog of good and bad intentions, mixed
motives, false standards.  Now he saw everything as
clear-cut and minute as if he looked through the
wrong end of a telescope.  Ward's death had
amazingly simplified life.  In retrospect he could see
the death of one of them as the only conceivable
solution; there had not been room in the world for
the two men and their passions.
</p>

<p>
The only emotion he was conscious of was an
almost impersonal satisfaction.  Once he had shot
a lioness that had terrorised a village; his sensations
had been similar&mdash;at a certain risk to himself
the world was quit of a pest.  He was satisfied,
moreover, at a clean job carried out efficiently with
his own hands...."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ross paused.  "It's easy," he said, "to go wrong
over Archie's feelings.  He was always so careful
to suppress them.  But that's the best I can piece
together from what he let fall, consciously and in
his delirium.  The result is not what your psychologist,
certainly not what your moralist, would like.
</p>

<p>
If you are inclined to side with these wise men
from the West, you must remember that on the
subject of Norah this hard-headed farmer was not
quite normal.  His love was that dominant weakness
through which, according to my theory, Africa
masters a man.  So the kiss that betrayed his love
shocked him not only into murder, not only into
callousness, but into a different epoch of morality.
The atrocity of his discovery seems to have atrophied
the segments of brain that are latest developed in
man&mdash;the convolutions that give refuge to mercy,
compassion, gentleness.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The vigorous young world was ignorant<br />
  Of these restrictions; 'tis decrepit now,<br />
  Not more devout, but more decayed and cold.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And Africa stood eager to welcome him to an
older world where force, not cunning, ruled; muscle,
not money, dominated; where Jehovah was God,
where an eye for an eye was sound morality; where
you killed your enemy, dashed his children against
the stones, and added his wives to your harem.  It
was Jehovah's gospel, not Christ's, not Mammon's,
that the forest whispered in Archie's ear.
</p>

<p>
Another avenue to remorse did Africa close, that
fear of discovery and of punishment that leads men
to contrition.  Murder is so safe in Central Africa.
Let me advise you to take your enemies on a shooting
trip there.  There in the solitude, far from
coroners' inquests, are a hundred agents of sudden
and silent death&mdash;snake-bite, blackwater, a crocodile,
sunstroke, a lion ... and a sun that makes
immediate burial unavoidable.
</p>

<p>
Any of these or a dozen other fates could be
adduced to explain Dick's disappearance; the natives
would ask no questions and carry no tales; and a
wife cannot, in English law, give evidence against
her husband.
</p>

<p>
So Africa was accessory after, as well as before,
the fact.  Archie may not have recognised her
proffered help; at the same time he can have felt none
of the anxiety and fear that so assist the workings
of conscience.  He blundered on through the trees,
caring only to set space between himself and Norah,
until chance brought him on the herd of eland.
</p>

<p>
His eye, which took in no detail of his course,
was caught by the quick movement of a horned
head plucking at a branch.  The sight of the great
antelope focused his vision on the rest of the herd,
whose humped bodies were no more than shadows
in the dappled gloom of the forest.
</p>

<p>
Dropping flat, he began to crawl into easy range.
No fancy shots, with ammunition so scarce.  As
he got near, he saw that the animal he stalked
was a cow.  Cautiously he knelt up and searched
among the trees for a bull.  He thought involuntarily
that, for the second time that day, he had
spared the female of the species.  He raised his
rifle and aimed behind the shoulder of a magnificent
bull who stood head up guarding his cows, his
horns hidden in the flat branches.  With faint
surprise he found compunction in his heart.  He
was loath now to tighten the trigger finger.  Half
an hour before he had felt no such qualm.
</p>

<p>
It was easier, it seemed, to kill a man than a
beast; much easier than an elephant, that you had
to hit in the thin wall of the skull on a line
between eye socket and ear hole.
</p>

<p>
If you didn't mind killing elephants, who did
you no harm, men were nothing&mdash;men who pressed
their hot lips against your wife's mouth.  Had he
experienced the slightest emotion when he had
levelled the sights on Ward, a hesitation of pity
such as he now felt for this fine bull? ... 'Head
shot or heart shot?' he had coolly debated, choosing
the latter as surer with a heavy gun and from
a standing posture.
</p>

<p>
Well, dark was falling and he must get that eland
or they'd be short of food.  He fired, and the beast
fell kicking.  The rest of the herd threw up their
heads in terror, standing wide-eyed and ignorant
which way to bolt.  Then with a brief scurry of
hoofs they were gone.
</p>

<p>
The silence was only broken by the difficult
breathing of the dying buck.  The sun, invisible
in the deepening clouds, warned Archie that, before
he could reach camp, dark would have fallen.  As
the meat must lie out all night, to protect it from
vultures and other scavengers, he began to break
off branches and tear up bracken.  Soon the eland
was hidden under a mound of foliage, black in the
failing light.  He kicked a little earth over a pool
of blood that might attract a jackal or a hyæna.
As he did so, another pool of blood with a woman's
skirt trailing in it rose before his eyes, and he
realised that what he did for an eland he must do
for a man.
</p>

<p>
Ward must be buried.  He could not be left to
the ministrations of the forest.  Archie's prodigious
impersonality had departed and he was conscious
of a violent distaste for the work before him.
Either his fever or his imagination brought physical
sickness, and he sat down on the ground till the
nausea passed.
</p>

<p>
He started to drag himself home.  His gun
seemed an intolerable weight now that his mood had
weakened.  For a moment he saw the murder as
a fault&mdash;not as a crime or an infraction of the
law&mdash;for the power of the forest was too absolute to
let this lawyer care much for legality&mdash;but as a
failure in hospitality.  Ward had come to him,
he remembered, for help, had put himself in his
power.  And the use he had made of his power was
to deal death where he promised escape.
</p>

<p>
Remorse passed as quickly as it had come when
he thought of the kiss which had forfeited Ward
his claim to help, safety, life.  But the duty of
burying Dick had never left his mind, where it bred a
fresh idea of his victim.
</p>

<p>
He no longer saw him in the abstract as the
enemy, the defiler of Norah's body, the pest which
must be killed.  He saw him as a dead man.  A
poor dead man.  <i>Un povero morte</i>, shut out from
the daylight, from sight and feel and smell, from
love of women, from hope and achievement.  All
he had now was stillness and a silence.
</p>

<p>
Archie felt no horror at his crime.  He stood
back from civilisation, remote from society, away
from the herd that had created morality to make
possible life in a herd.  But pity took hold of him,
pity for his victim, who was also, he saw, the victim
of exasperating circumstance, of passions and
stupidities.  And heavily&mdash;if justly&mdash;had he paid.
</p>

<p>
A growl of thunder diverted his attention.  It
did not sound very distant.  He hoped the rains
would not break yet, but he quickened his aching
steps.
</p>

<p>
It was dark when he reached the ruins and found
no trace of the body he had come to bury.  Even
in the obscurity he expected that he would have
seen the white clothes.  They would not be so
white now, but something should be visible.  Had
Norah had it carried into camp?  If she had, that
showed beyond palliation that she was careless of
her husband's fate.
</p>

<p>
Had he come to the right spot?  Yes, this was
where he had stood.  Ward over there, with Norah.
He had fallen forwards.  His body should lie here.
Archie fancied he could smell the pool of blood,
and the light of a match justified his senses.
</p>

<p>
He lit another and saw that the grass was bent
and broken.  In Ward's death agony?  Or had
the body been dragged away?  He followed the
wake in the grass, striking matches as he went, till
at a distance of some fifty yards he came on the
stained, white bundle.  He had not come in time.
Hyaenas, a flicker of lightning revealed, had been
before him.  The poor corpse was already mutilated.
His pity for the dead man gathered force.  He
had never admired Ward's good looks (secretly he
may have been jealous of them), but he knew they
were there, and against his will he had been
conscious of the man's light-hearted charm.  Now this
helpless, shapeless thing worried by the beasts of
night was all that remained.
</p>

<p>
It was the war again, he thought.  Bodies of
Germans hanging on the wire&mdash;sons, husbands,
lovers of some one bereaved in Germany.  Only
here the consolation was lacking of sacrifice for a
country.  Ward had died in no nobler quarrel than
the fight of two dogs over a bitch.
</p>

<p>
For the first time it occurred to him that his
victim was a human being.  He had seen and killed
him as an abstraction&mdash;the betrayer of Norah; he
had seen him and pitied him as a corpse: now he
knew that he had been a human being with human
faults and qualities, human interests, human
relationships; somewhere he had a family, friends, a
home.
</p>

<p>
And to-night he must bury him far from all that.
He faced the problem of the burial.  The work
must be done with his own hands and the carriers
must know nothing.  He could give out that Ward
had been taken by a crocodile on the shore of the
lake.  The noise of shooting would be explained by
eland meat he would send them to fetch next day.
The first round fired would have missed.  He passed
to other considerations.
</p>

<p>
The digging must be done with a broad bladed
native hoe that was tied on to one of his loads
for general camp use.  There was no spade.  The
ground was iron-hard and the tool inefficient.  It
would take his fever-weighted arms several hours
to dig even a shallow grave.  Fortunately the moon
would shortly be up.  He decided to fetch the hoe
at once, and to light a small fire of brushwood to
keep away hyænas and their kind.  Then he
remembered that in camp he would find Norah.  The
thought swept away his unnatural calm.
</p>

<p>
It was not that he still feared the temptation to
outrage Norah by word or action, even to kill her.
That moment of bleak rage had faded and would
never return.  Nor did he feel horror of the
prospect of facing the woman whose lover's blood was
wet on his hands, his body yet unburied.  Yet,
rather than cross to his camp and meet his wife, he
would have preferred to stay in the company of the
part-eaten corpse of the man he had shot down.
</p>

<p>
The pain he had felt, when he first learnt in that
sunlit clearing that Norah was untrue, had been
diffuse.  Grief attacked his heart from many sides
and numbed it.  Despair mingled with puzzlement;
self-reproach merged into anger.  Norah he had
been slow to blame, making his own shortcomings
scapegoat and Ward's seduction.  That she was
guiltless, that her chastity was intact he could not
pretend; but he found excuses and put his love
at the five-barred gate of prejudice.  Love saved
him the shock of his wife's sinfulness that most
men would have suffered, accepting the boom in
virginity engineered by a Church that is celibate
at heart and the great ring of women with plain
daughters to marry.
</p>

<p>
But if Archie had tried to ignore his wife's
infidelity and in his heart had longed to forgive it,
disillusionment now seared him with hotter irons.
His body and brain seemed to ache with the
question&mdash;why in the morning say she was ready to
come back to him and had left Dick Ward for ever,
to be caught ere evening in his passionate embrace?
</p>

<p>
There were only two answers:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It might be that, faithless herself, she had not
believed his promise to bring her and her lover
safe back to Abercorn.  To make sure their escape
she had coldly tortured him with lying offers, had
tricked him with a flattering tale.  Could it be true
that the girl he had worshipped as all that was
loyal, all that was high-hearted, had fallen to this
treachery, grovelled in such cowardice and cruelty?
</p>

<p>
But if that was not the truth, then his clean,
lovely Norah was a harlot so wanton, so rotten,
she could not keep for an hour out of a man's arms,
could not for a few days stay faithful.  The day
she was left on the farm welcoming a lover;
renouncing him as soon as her husband found her;
slinking back the same night.
</p>

<p>
He must accept, it seemed, one of these
unendurable explanations.  Where both so base, did it
matter which was true?  He had married and
adored either a wanton or a traitress.  Was further
scrutiny necessary?  Was not the only manly
course amputation, to cut the woman out of his life?
</p>

<p>
When first he had learnt that she had left him,
he had grieved for Norah as one untimely dead, lost
to him but still dear.  Now he must think of her
not only as lost, but dishonoured.  That he still
loved her, degraded him to her level.  She had eaten
her way into his life like rust, had twined her
fingers through his heart-strings.  Before it was
too late, he must tear himself free of her magic.
</p>

<p>
He faced the issue squarely.  Suppose he
surrendered to the love, which still impregnated his
tormented being, and took Norah back, what peace
would there be for either?  Could he ever for a
moment forget her character as this blinding moment
had revealed it?  Could he ever trust her word?
When she spoke to him he would divine a hidden
sense; when she kissed him he would see a lure.  He
would have sold his manhood for deception and a
mockery.
</p>

<p>
No, once he had rescued her from the danger of
the moment, he must break through the net that
entangled him.  The world would be bare enough
without Norah, without the farm, without mankind's
major compensations for living&mdash;love and
work.
</p>

<p>
Even suicide was inadmissible.  If he killed
himself here, what would happen to Norah?
</p>

<p>
Some heavy drops of rain recalled him to the
work that faced him.  He must fetch the hoe.  If
he met Norah, he need not speak to her.  Sometime
he must tell her what he had decided, that could
wait.  There was now a man to be buried, a raft
to be built, a journey to be begun.  Plenty for
one man to do, with fever.  Then he'd have to go to
the first Boma and give them a story of Ward's
death.  Unless, of course, Norah betrayed him.
That, and anything, was now possible.
</p>

<p>
He found it difficult to raise himself from the
heap of masonry on which he was sitting.  His
limbs seemed to have stiffened and he shook with
ague.  Laboriously he dragged brushwood and
creepers near the corpse and put a match to the heap.
</p>

<p>
Then without looking round, he walked heavily
to the camp.  The unsteady illumination of
lightning showed him his path."

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII
</h3>

<p>
That afternoon when Norah had helped
Archie down the hillside, where the work
of transporting the logs was in process and where
she had made her difficult offer of reconciliation, it
had not been easy to persuade him to take his fever
to bed.
</p>

<p>
She had at last overcome his conviction that the
carriers could not be left alone by promising that
she herself would watch the work.  So she had spent
the whole morning and most of the afternoon
walking behind the gang in their slow passage between
hillside and lake, until the full number of logs that
Archie needed to build the rafts lay ranged on the
shore.
</p>

<p>
Leaving the workers rolling lushishi ropes between
the palm of their hands and the flat of their thighs,
with orders to make a certain length before they
knocked off for the night, she started in search of
Dick to tell him she was going back to Archie.  She
dreaded the task before her.  Her generosity shrank
from the wreck she must work in Dick's dreams.
That morning she had had to sacrifice her pride;
now Dick's romance was the victim.  Her days
seemed a string of unendurable tasks.
</p>

<p>
Somehow she had mismanaged her offer to Archie.
Instead of relieving him she had added to his
distress.  And the news she had for Dick, in its nature,
carried nothing but pain.  She scourged her imagination
for some means to soften the blow.
</p>

<p>
As she meditated she caught sight of Dick's tall
white-clad figure on one of the mounds that marked
where the monastery had stood.  She noticed that
he had listened to Archie's monosyllabic advice, not
to go far afield without his gun, as the rocks might
harbour leopards.  'That's where those two rounds
come in,' Archie had muttered.
</p>

<p>
She shouted to Dick, but the distance absorbed
her voice.  Forgetting fear of the ruins in dislike
for her mission, she clambered up the shattered
stairway.
</p>

<p>
Dick was plainly glad to see her.  She had not
been near him since dinner the night before, and
she was struck by the change.  He seemed to have
filled out to the dimensions of his old care-free self.
The storm of panic and jealousy had passed and
left no mark, for Dick was one of those fortunate
beings who can emerge on the far side of the Valley
of the Shadow with an unimpaired flow of small
talk.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I've just seen a water-spout,' he told her.
</p>

<p>
Norah examined him with wonder.  His eyes
were clear and happy, his manner without embarrassment,
his bearing debonair&mdash;the Dick she had known
and loved.  He seemed unaffected by the heat,
his hair well brushed and white clothes spotless and
tidy.  With his white topee on his head and the
Mauser in his hand, he looked, she told him, like
the frontispiece of a South Sea novel.
</p>

<p>
Where was the water-spout, she asked him.  It
was over on the far side, he said, a wisp of opaque
mist joining the lake with a cloud.  Snow-white at
its foot; grey where it met the cloud.
</p>

<p>
'A pillar?' asked Norah, putting off the moment
she dreaded.
</p>

<p>
'No, it sort of trailed.  Wide at the base and the
top; pinched in at the middle.'
</p>

<p>
She watched his hands as he tried to describe
the vortex.  He used them in conversation more
than most Englishmen, perhaps because they were
long and well shaped.  She remembered how the
touch of them had once thrilled her.
</p>

<p>
That magic had departed; exorcised by her better
knowledge of him; or perhaps only overlaid.  For
the moment she was empty of all passion.  Suspense,
shame, pity had squeezed her dry like a sponge.
When life flowed back into her veins, would the
spell resume its dominion?  Now she was nothing
but a brain dispassionately scheming the redress of
the wrong she had wrought, and grappling with the
consequences.  But one day, when the crisis was
over, she knew her body would come to life.  Would
it then remember those well-shaped hands?
</p>

<p>
'Well,' she told herself unsympathetically, 'it
would have to.'  If Archie had not her heart, he
had her word.  And ignorant of the blow she must
deal him, Dick talked gaily of a dozen different
matters.  He pointed to a stretch of opposite coast
that was blotted from sight.  The sky above the
gap was a black fog that shredded into streamers of
cloud.  The hills on either side of the gap lay clear
and clean in the sunlight.
</p>

<p>
'Rain,' said Dick, 'it'll be cooler here soon.'  But
since she had told Archie her decision, Norah's
anxiety about the heat and its possible effects had
been relieved.
</p>

<p>
'Dick,' she said, 'listen to me for a minute.'  Pity
poured into her.  Contempt had given way to
understanding.  For all his thirty years he was only a
boy.  Good-looking, attractive, lovable.  All his
possibilities were in sight.  He had no reserves to
draw on and, if he had failed in the hour of test, the
fire had been hot indeed.
</p>

<p>
'Dick, haven't you noticed,' she began, 'haven't
you noticed that nothing good lasts?  Sooner or
later one goes back to school.'
</p>

<p>
'What <i>is</i> the matter?' he asked.
</p>

<p>
'Everything,' she said.  'But there's no need for
you to mind.  The world's full of pretty women&mdash;and
ones that won't let you down.'
</p>

<p>
'Optimist!' he laughed, 'what are you talking
about?'
</p>

<p>
I'm trying to tell you....  It's all finished
now, Dick.  Oh, do understand! we're through.'
</p>

<p>
Norah had counted on a painful reception of her
words&mdash;prayers, protests, despair.  It had not
occurred to her that she might be met with blank
incredulity.
</p>

<p>
'My dearest child,' he said, 'you're mad.'
</p>

<p>
She wanted to tell him that outside the natives
she was the only sane person in the bay, but he
would not listen.
</p>

<p>
'You're nervy,' he said.  'I don't wonder.  I was
nervy myself yesterday.  I imagined all sorts of
rubbish about Sinclair.'
</p>

<p>
'I'm going back to Archie,' she managed to put in.
</p>

<p>
'Yesterday I thought he'd got something up his
sleeve,' Dick went on without seeming to hear her,
'but I know I was wrong.  I think he's behaved
jolly well.  He doesn't mean to interfere with us in
any way.  Of course it's rough on him, but that is
life.'
</p>

<p>
Dick's mercurial temper had asserted itself.
Starvation, death, violence seemed very far away.
His sky was clear.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, do listen!' cried Norah.
</p>

<p>
She was getting hysterical, he thought.  No
wonder, either.  But he must not give way to her
fancies.  He kept up a steady flow of reassurance.
When at last the stream ran dry&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Dick, listen,' she spoke very slowly, dividing the
syllables.  'I've&mdash;told&mdash;Archie&mdash;I'll&mdash;go&mdash;back&mdash;to him.'
</p>

<p>
When the words had left her lips their brutality
appalled her.  She had hurt Dick as she had hurt
Archie.  If only he had not forced her to speak out.
</p>

<p>
Her calm impressed his optimism.  He dropped
his rifle, which clanged against the hidden masonry.
</p>

<p>
'Good God!' he said, 'do you mean it?'
</p>

<p>
She nodded her head wearily.
</p>

<p>
'You've told Sinclair you'd chuck me?  Damn
it, Norah...' and his disappointment found vent
in anger and in abuse of Archie.
</p>

<p>
Norah saw she must stop him.  Their short
romance had been disastrous: it need not be made
ugly.
</p>

<p>
'Don't,' she cried, 'don't spoil it now.  Leave it
so that one day we can look back without distaste.
Part has been good.  Don't throw that away.'  He
opened his mouth to answer.
</p>

<p>
'Murder's better done in silence,' she said, and
walked a few steps away.
</p>

<p>
Dick's affection for Norah was real and shamed
him into the silence she begged.  After a moment&mdash;'I'm
sorry,' he said, 'I was a brute.  But it's such
a shock.'  Then coaxing her: 'Norah, say you don't
mean it, say it's all a nightmare.'
</p>

<p>
She sat down on a pile of rubble overgrown with
creepers.  He knelt beside her and slipped his arm
round her body.
</p>

<p>
'Norah, it can't be over yet.  We'd only just
started.'  His face came close to hers.  'It was going
to be so heavenly.'
</p>

<p>
She made to rise but Dick held her fast and
crushed his lips on to hers.
</p>

<p>
What were Dick Ward's motives in kissing the
mouth that had just renounced him?  He may have
trusted to the caress, with the memories it would
revive, to soothe what he deemed disordered nerves.
He may have hoped to burn away her scruples in a
kiss.  Or, more simply, the nearness of her body, so
soon to be lost to him, may have set his veins a-throb
and deprived him of reason.  He never had the
opportunity to explain.
</p>

<p>
In the hours that followed Norah was to curse
the kiss so negligently accepted&mdash;suffered, rather, in
weariness and compassion.  She felt a great pity for
Dick.  With his gallant exterior and weakness
beneath, he was so ill-equipped for the hand-to-hand
fight that is Life.  So easily hurt.  She wanted in
his dark hour to let him down as lightly as she could.
If every word of hers, every action, was to breed
suffering for the two men who loved her, it seemed
ungenerous to forbid anything that might ease the
pain.  If kissing her was any help....
</p>

<p>
After all it seemed prudish to balk at a kiss from
one who had so recently possessed her.  And since
it stirred in her no breath of passion, whom could
it hurt?  So if kissing made parting easier...?
And she was weary, mind and body; the interviews
with Archie and Dick had taken all her strength;
for the moment she was as passive as the dead.
What did a kiss more or less matter?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next moment, she was kneeling by a corpse.
</p>

<p>
Death, when it comes suddenly, is so incredible,
that for some time she worked to bring back
consciousness.
</p>

<p>
At last she desisted and her senses and intelligence
confirmed the fact of death; still she took in nothing.
Mechanically she closed his eyes and mechanically
stayed on her knees, trying to pray for a spirit
released on Eternity all unready.  But she would
have been less astonished, when she opened her eyes
at last, to see him standing there gay and immaculate
with a smile on his face and a word of love on his
tongue, than to find him lying stiff and contorted in
the disorder of violent death.  Was it believable
that the mouth, which a matter of seconds before had
so feverishly sought hers, was set in that grimace as
long as any flesh was on it?  That the body, whose
warmth she felt against her heart, was growing
colder, never to be warm again ... unless
putrefaction engenders heat?
</p>

<p>
To occupy her hands she lifted his rifle, playing
with it aimlessly.  What deadly toys men had!
She turned the weapon in her hands, half opened
the breech.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was still in her grasp when she reached the
camp, where Changalilo took it from her to clean.
She felt that henceforward life would consist of
minute, valueless acts like handing a rifle to a native,
changing a skirt, sitting down on a chair.  Nothing
would ever matter again.  'All things are full of
labour: man cannot utter it: the eye is not satisfied
with seeing, nor the ear with hearing.'
</p>

<p>
The workers were in sight, still rolling ropes of
lushishi: even in this backwater, life did not pause
in the presence of death.  She felt she must get close
to living beings, but when she had joined them, she
found in their proximity no relief.  They were too
calm and unconcerned, too alien to her.  She
dismissed them for the day and turned back to camp.
</p>

<p>
Her eye fell on Archie's shelter and travelled to
the rain clouds....  With his fever ... his fever
was bad.  Perhaps if he had been normal he would
not have ... how was the quinine going?  She
fetched the bottle and tipped out the tablets,
counting them slowly.  She lost count and started again.
The bottle would not last many more days.  She
must warn Archie.  She took up the flowers she
had picked that morning while she watched the
log-hauling&mdash;purple orchids from a patch of swampy
ground by the yellow river.  Their clear, bright
colour caught hold of her emptied mind.  It seemed
to matter more than anything else that was left in
the world.  She pinned a bunch against her white
jumper.  As she did so, she noticed they made her
hand smell of musk, and ever afterwards the odour
of musk made her think of blood.
</p>

<p>
Unpinning them, she discovered that she hated
their sophisticated little faces.  She threw the bunch
away and tried to wash the musk from her hands.
But the scent lingered faintly.
</p>

<p>
All the while, she was detached from her actions,
as if her intelligence had been carried high up into
the air whence, at an immense distance, it watched
her body mooning about with flowers, loving them
and quarrelling with them like an idiot child in a
limpid poem by Wordsworth.
</p>

<p>
But inactivity increased her anguish.  She had
the sensation of abominable things lurking behind
her, ready to spring if she began to think.  She
picked up the needlework she had been busy with
on the <i>Mimi</i>, and tried to stitch.  Her fingers
trembled too much and she sat staring blankly at
the sewing until she dropped it with a despairing
gesture.  It was a sock of Dick's that she had
started to darn.
</p>

<p>
The trivial shock seemed at last to clear her brain
and it bore on her that Dick was dead and killed by
Archie.  That the calamity she had foreseen had
happened.  She tried to believe that from the first
she had seen no human power could ride the storm
of the two men's passions.  But in truth she had
never doubted that her wit would find a way.  She
had divined the danger, faced it and, she believed,
by the sacrifice of her every sensibility, had mastered
it.  Then one act of pointless surrender had brought
her contriving to bloody ruin!  The idea that Archie
might see her loveless embrace and by it be goaded
to strike had never crossed her brain.  Had her
mind not been dulled by the three days' ceaseless
stress, it would have refused Dick the fatal
consolation of that barren kiss.
</p>

<p>
By her blind sympathy, by the abandonment of a
moment, she had killed him.  To the two men she
loved she had brought ruin and death.  Her own act
had made her the wife of a murderer and the mistress
of his victim.  &OElig;dipus, slaying his father and
marrying his mother, Rigoletto stabbing his daughter for
the seducer he had abetted, were no more
blood-guilty than she.
</p>

<p>
She tried to forget what was irreparable.  What
did the future hold?
</p>

<p>
One glimpse was enough.  A black frame, in the
middle of which a body, with a cloth over its face,
hung, twitching a little.  She put her hands over
her eyes, but imagination had no mercy.
</p>

<p>
She waited now in the airless court, waited to
hear Archie sentenced to spend his youth in a prison
or pay life for life.  She saw the indifferent,
dispassionate features of the barristers; the old, grave
face of the judge; the inhuman pomp of Justice,
only less terrible than the degraded ceremonial of
the scaffold.
</p>

<p>
And his father would be there.  She would have
to tell him....  How could she save Archie?  If
payment was claimed, it was she who must pay.
She would force him to be prudent, to cover up the
traces of blood, to plan an escape.
</p>

<p>
At any moment, one of the carriers, released from
work, wandering afield looking for wild honey,
might stumble on the corpse.  She braced herself
for action and told Changalilo to collect the natives.
Anxiously she counted them; they were all there.
How could she keep them from the place of death?
</p>

<p>
'Tell them,' she bade the servant, 'to-night it will
rain.  They must thatch their shelters, now, without
waiting.'
</p>

<p>
She showed him where they were to pull the grass
for thatching.  She stood over them to see they did
not wander.  Changalilo asked if he should prepare
Archie's bath.  Where could Archie be all this time?
By now it was nearly dark.  Changalilo said he had
heard shots, the last one just audible.  The Bwana,
he suggested, had wounded and followed game.
</p>

<p>
His words evoked a fresh horror.  That distant
gun!  For a terrible moment she saw a second figure
in the lonely hills, lying in its blood.
</p>

<p>
She shut the image out.  Archie, of all men, however
little he wished to live, would not leave her on
this haunted shore to face starvation alone.  She
wondered if he had collapsed from fever alone in the
bush.  Only fear of what the natives might find on
their way stopped her from leading a search party.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that hours passed before the sound of
slow footsteps in the dead leaves fell on her ear and
Archie's bowed figure crossed the circle of the
firelight.  Even in the reddish glow his face was pale
and he walked as if each motion called for a separate
effort of will.
</p>

<p>
She moved to meet him, to take his hand, but he
kept his eyes turned to the ground and carried his
gun to the shelter.  She heard the bed creak under
his weight.  She had no inkling of the baseness he
had read into her acts, and only her respect for
his obvious wish to be left alone stopped her
following him.  Could he not see the urgent need to give
the natives some reason for Dick's ... absence?
To forestall curiosity?  Talk spread through the
villages and from the villages might reach a Boma.
Inquiry would follow, the carriers would be sent for
and the story pieced together.  She forced herself to
keep quiet, crediting Archie with agony of conscience
that he did not, in fact, feel.
</p>

<p>
When she could endure inactivity no longer, she
crossed to the shelter and looked in.  Archie was
sitting on his bed, his chin dug into his chest and his
rifle across his knees.
</p>

<p>
'Archie,' she said softly.
</p>

<p>
He took no notice.
</p>

<p>
She repeated his name.
</p>

<p>
'For Christ's sake, Norah!' he said.
</p>

<p>
'No, listen to me,' she began again, 'don't think
about ... what's happened.'
</p>

<p>
'Not think about what's happened?' he echoed as
if he could not believe he heard her words right.
</p>

<p>
'Think what you'll tell the natives,' she said.  But
he only stared as if he had never seen her before.
</p>

<p>
At last he spoke.  'Norah!' he began, then checked
himself, and as if, she thought, he was fleeing from
her presence, shouldered his way out of the shelter.
</p>

<p>
She stood where she was, unconscious of the
repugnance she had inspired.  Had horror swept him
beyond clear thought and speech?  Or did he think
his company intolerable while his hands were wet
with her lover's blood?  Where was he going?  Out
into the forest, driven by his thoughts?  Or
maddened by remorse to betray himself?
</p>

<p>
He was calling Matao to him and speaking loud
and in Chi-wemba, so that the attentive group of
carriers, sprawling by the fire, chewing dried strips
of yesterday's meat, could hear.  She gathered the
sense of his words.
</p>

<p>
He had killed, he said, an eland in the hills.  The
announcement was received with murmurs of
contentment and the firelight caught the gleams of
teeth revealed by wide, smiling lips.
</p>

<p>
It was a big bull, he went on, and there would be
much meat for every one.  The prone figures twisted
over on to their knees and clapped their hands softly
in token of gratitude.
</p>

<p>
After he had taken them, he continued, to the
meat at dawn, work would start on the rafts, ready
to leave the bay in the afternoon.
</p>

<p>
He began to speak lower, but his voice did not
falter.  Bwana Dick, he said, was missing.  He
feared something had befallen him.  His words were
received, it seemed to Norah, in complete apathy.
The goings on of the strange white man were no
concern of the people.
</p>

<p>
The Bwana, said Archie, had started towards the
northern arm of the bay, looking for fish.  He had
not returned.  Archie paused, but the natives
listened in a detached silence.
</p>

<p>
Shortly before dark, he continued, he had heard
a sound like a cry.  It came from the beach.  He
looked at the natives, but no one made a sound.  He
bade Matao inquire if any of them had heard it.
Matao saluted and whispering started.  Archie
waited awhile before he finished his tale.
</p>

<p>
He had gone, he said at last, in the direction of
the cry, and had found Dick's footprints in the sand
... and the spoor of a crocodile.  He stopped
speaking.
</p>

<p>
The natives were in eager discussion.  They were
interested, thought Norah, in this version of Dick's
death, not as a tragedy but as a sort of sporting event
between a man and a crocodile.  Then her heart
stood still.  Their unfailing interest in game of all
sorts would draw them next morning, however
indifferent to Dick's fate, to the beach to see the
spoor and trace the struggle.  And they would find
smooth shingle: not a mark to confirm the story.
Why, oh! why had Archie not consulted her?  She
could have devised a story less vulnerable than that.
</p>

<p>
The whispering ceased as a native rose, helping
himself up by his spear struck into the ground.  With
quick gesture he told his story, starting, as natives
do, with happenings of days before.  How Bwana
A-ri-shy had brought them in canoes across the lake;
how Bwana Dick-i had come by night; of the migration
to the bay and the trees they had felled.
</p>

<p>
Archie listened imperturbably to the rambling
statement.  At last the man came to the point.  He
had been sent by Matao to soak some lushishi in the
margin of the lake.  While he did so he heard a
shout.
</p>

<p>
'Who shouted?' asked Archie quickly.
</p>

<p>
'It was like Bwana Dick-i's voice, but frightened.'
</p>

<p>
'At what hour?'
</p>

<p>
The native indicated the height of the sun in the
heavens.
</p>

<p>
'From what direction?'
</p>

<p>
He pointed towards the northern arm of the bay,
away from the ruins.
</p>

<p>
What had he thought?
</p>

<p>
He had thought nothing.
</p>

<p>
Norah breathed more freely.  The black man's
child-like anxiety to stand in the limelight had
brought confirmation to Archie's story.
</p>

<p>
He dismissed the two natives and retired to his
shelter.  Norah watched the group by the fire resume
their business of meat and sleep.  Presently she saw
Archie with an unlit hurricane lamp in his hand walk
out of the circle of light in the direction of the
latrine.  She saw him stoop and pick something off
the ground.  A hoe, she knew, always lay about there.
Then he disappeared in the direction of the ruins.
</p>

<p>
She guessed where he was going and on how
ghastly an errand.  Why wouldn't he confide in her?
She would never have agreed to that crocodile story,
whose falsehood to-morrow would prove.  How
could she undo the mistake he had made?  How
could the natives be kept from the shore on some
pretext not too transparent?
</p>

<p>
The storm was getting closer.  Crashes of thunder
were more frequent and louder.  The flicker of
lightning was incessant.  It revealed, concealed,
revealed the walls of the crater that had trapped
them.  Those old hills, had they ever seen pain
like this before?  Pain, the only rival in man's
experience of their immortality.  Peoples emerge and
disappear, gods are honoured and forgotten, pain
alone endures.
</p>

<p>
A wind began to blow, cold wet gusts that drove
the heavy stale air before them.  The night grew
darker.  A distant hissing sound came nearer and
clearer, like the approach of a railway train.  The
boughs of the forest lashed and waved.  The noise
resolved into the slash of rain on leaves.  A moment
of lightning disclosed the oncoming of an opaque
wall of water.  The deluge burst on the camp.
</p>

<p>
Norah faced the rain, bending her body to withstand
its violence.  Her eyes were blinded but her
brain seemed to be cleared.  Great relief filled her
heart, tempered by a foreboding that such luck could
not endure; for the traces of the imaginary struggle
would be washed from the shore before morning.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Near the crumbling shell of the church tower,
which seemed in the tremulous illumination of the
storm to bob and stagger at each recurring crash of
thunder, naked to the waist, smeared with mud,
dripping with rain and sweat, Archie dug.
</p>

<p>
His lantern was perched on the heap of liquefying
earth he had thrown up behind him.  Each gust
reeled the flame over to the brink of extinction and
whistled sibilantly through the air holes.
</p>

<p>
He worked slowly, but without pausing even to
throw off the water which ran over his eyebrows
and into his eyes, or to free his shorts which flapped
clammily against his legs.  As he dug, the rain ran
into the grave, so that his boots squelched in the
mud and once he slipped, falling with his face in
the loose earth he had thrown out.  Each hoeful
had to be tossed up on to the heap, the hoe held
by the heel and handle.  His lumbar muscles rose
under the strain, catching the dull gleam of the lamp.
</p>

<p>
When he had dug for a couple of hours, the moon
appeared and the clouds thinned to wisps of black
vapour that scudded across her face.  The roar of
the rain in the forest was lowered, till the drip of
each separate leaf seemed audible over an undertone
of the surge of the waves on the lake.  The
smell of the earth, wet after seven months' drought,
rose and the perfume of fresh green.
</p>

<p>
Archie clambered out of the hole and measured
it depth with the handle of his hoe.  Apparently
satisfied, he walked over to where Ward's body lay
and tried to lift it.  But Dick had been a big man
and Archie was a small one, exhausted with fever
and back-breaking labour.  With a shrug of the
shoulders he abandoned the effort and taking hold
of the corpse by the collar he dragged it over the
uneven ground to the grave.
</p>

<p>
He laid it supine and endeavoured to straighten
the twisted limbs.  Already the body was stiff and
resisted him.  So he pushed it into the resting-place
he had prepared.  But in its bent-up attitude the
knees stuck out of the shallow grave and Archie had
to roll it over on to its side.
</p>

<p>
Without waiting he started to pull earth into the
grave, using his hoe sideways as a scraper.  As the
soil tumbled in, he reflected, with wonder and no
bitterness, that the face his wife had so lately kissed
was now pressed into the cold, wet earth....
</p>

<p>
Then he heaped broken bricks from the debris of
the church on the place, lest a hyæna should undo
his work...."

<h3>
CHAPTER I
</h3>

<p>
"Abercorn," said Ross, lighting his third
consecutive cigar, "was laid out some quarter of
a century ago by a far-sighted and optimistic official
on the lines of Paris.  There are boulevards and
'rond points'; avenues of thuja and eucalyptus;
terraces and squares.  And at the present moment there
are five dwelling-houses, a block of government
offices, a jail and post office, one European and three
native stores.
</p>

<p>
The settlement is served by two railway systems,
one distant four hundred miles to the north, the other
six hundred to the south.
</p>

<p>
I suppose it is what you writers call 'an outpost
of civilisation,' but civilised it seemed to me after
six weeks of ulendo through the bush! and urban, to
the point of decadence, it must have looked to Archie
emerging from the virginal bosom of the 'fly' belt.
</p>

<p>
Red Dog, Manitoba; Bloggsville, Wisconsin;
Smitsdorp, Transvaal; from what I hear these spots
breathe a red-blooded life dear to cinematograph
producers, without being remarkable either for
comfort or refinement.
</p>

<p>
How different these tiny Boma towns of North-Eastern
Rhodesia that have only existed a decade or
two!  You are at once struck by the absence of red
dust, corrugated iron, spittoons.  Books may be
found in every house, water colours or etchings too;
comfortable arm-chairs and cushions; nice china and
plate; occasionally a piano.  The standard of
comfort is above the average of an English country
rectory.  And the issues that confront the
population are often as vital.
</p>

<p>
A few days before I reached Abercorn, short of
two loads, whose carriers had fallen sick on the way,
one of these crises had begun to darken the horizon.
I was privileged to hear at least one side of the
question that was dividing the township, the side
of which Mrs. Lavater was protagonist.  Lavater
was the D.C., and very kindly he had housed me
until my loads caught up and I could go on to my
fishing camp.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lavater is one of those big-boned,
deep-bosomed, high-coloured women, who have done so
much to make the Empire what it is.  Were they
endowed with any sense of humour, would that
Empire be what it is?  It is a doubtful question.
</p>

<p>
'What I told Mackenzie,' she was saying as she
poured out the China tea for which she was rightly
famous, 'was that the money was raised by the golf
club and it ought to be spent on improving the golf
course.  I say we could start a new nine holes.'
</p>

<p>
King Arthur could not have mentioned the Quest
of the Holy Grail in tones of greater reverence.
</p>

<p>
'It's all because,' she sank her voice,
'Mrs. Mackenzie won&mdash;or so she told me&mdash;a silver
inkstand in the mixed doubles at Eastbourne in 1913.
That's why he's fussing about a tennis court.'
</p>

<p>
I was lost in banal admiration of our race.
Wherever two or three are gathered together, there
shall golf, tennis and the seeds of England's
greatness be found.
</p>

<p>
'They find a desert and leave it a links,' I
murmured.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lavater said she was delighted that I agreed
with her about the second nine....  She stared
firmly out of the window.  Had her pince-nez been
endowed with supernatural vision; could they have
pierced a range of tree-clad hills and embraced a
couple of hundred miles of forest and lake; she
might at that moment have seen Archie's carriers
splashing knee deep in the tepid water, tugging at
the lushishi cords, which dragged the second raft,
grating down its path of rollers, reluctantly on to
the lake.
</p>

<p>
The other raft already rode on the mirror-like
surface.  On its rough-hewn timbers a pile of
bedding had been arranged for Norah.  Her neat
white clothes looked incongruous, for the uncouth
craft and the theatrical blue of sky and water seemed
to demand for passenger some shaggy Crusoe of
pantomime.
</p>

<p>
Rifle in hand, Archie knelt on a round black rock
that projected into the lake, his neck stretched and
his eyes intent for any sign that the crocodiles had
not been scared away by the noise.
</p>

<p>
The singing rose louder as the second craft slipped
jerkily into the water, sending angry little waves to
slap against the logs that supported Norah.
</p>

<p>
As the work of balancing the loads progressed,
Archie from his rock called out the names.
'Mulenga, behind the Mama.  Benesh, on the other raft,
beside the kitchen box....'
</p>

<p>
As he was named, each native raised his ragged
clothes as high as decency and Norah's presence
would permit and climbed to his place, poising on
his head his few possessions&mdash;a torn reed mat or a
black clay cooking pot, an iron spear or axe, and
strips of dried meat that tainted the air.  With each
fresh comer's weight, the raft dipped and danced....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
By the following Saturday Mr. Mackenzie had
completed a house-to-house canvas of the ten adult
inhabitants of Abercorn.  Hume the Postmaster, the
doctor and the Assistant Native Commissioner had
rallied to the Mackenzie standard.  At four o'clock
their leader, girt in a stiff collar, called officially
to inform Mrs. Lavater that a tennis court was
demanded by the majority of the town.
</p>

<p>
He dropped his bomb and retreated outwardly
triumphant, but in his heart uneasy, for he knew
how hardly women like Mrs. Lavater accept defeat.
A sudden scurry of rain sent him for shelter into the
post office, where he confided in Hume that he had
not liked 'the calm way she took it.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
At lake level that scurry of rain was magnified
into a vicious little squall that nearly ended Archie's
and Norah's problems before their destined time.
</p>

<p>
The rafts were crawling over the glassy surface
under the slow urge of unaccustomed arms.  Their
course pointed from headland to headland of a bay
that bit deep into the thickly wooded slope.
</p>

<p>
Archie, since a hippo, inquisitive or frightened,
had risen under the baggage raft and tipped its crew
into the crocodile-infested water, had left Matao in
the bows to keep a look-out ahead and had posted
himself in the stern of his craft, his rifle across his
knees, his eyes plumbing the bottomless blue of the
lake.  Some instinct, or perhaps the continuous drone
of Matao's voice, made him turn, to catch his lookout
man absorbed in conversation with the bow
paddler.
</p>

<p>
He snatched the steersman's paddle and the water
churned as he headed the clumsy craft landwards.
For where the headland should have shown clear in
their path stood a blank wall of mist.  Alive at last
to their danger, the unskilled paddlers strained their
strength to drive the heavy rafts to shore, but, in
spite of their efforts, the squall gained on them.  The
sky darkened and they heard the oncoming howl of
the wind.
</p>

<p>
Their breath hissed between their teeth, their
muscles stood in knots on their arms and naked
backs, as Archie, paddling with long, quick strokes,
urged them on.  Waves splashed over the raft,
drenching Norah to the skin, and stinging her
delicate body with their impact.  The last slapped up
full in her face, setting her spluttering with its
brackish taste and clinging with her slim fingers to
the knotted logs.  Two of the loads broke loose and
swept past her lakewards.
</p>

<p>
Archie dropped his paddle and, tearing up the
bark rope that lashed the raft, looped the free end
round her waist.  Then the rain broke on them,
driving in horizontal sheets.  Norah shut her eyes to save
her sight.  She opened them to see Archie leap from
the raft.  Her heart stood still, till she saw him
standing chest-high in the surf and heard him bellow
to her to put her arms round his neck....
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The day following that scurry of rain, Mrs. Lavater
launched her counter attack, which proved
to be nothing more sinister than the convention of the
members of the Golf Club (a body differing from
the population of Abercorn by the exclusion of
children under twelve&mdash;see Rule Four) to discuss
the motion 'that this meeting approves the
enlargement of the links.'
</p>

<p>
The Mackenzie faction, secure in their canvassed
majority of five against four (for the D.C. stood
firm in his neutrality), arrived to find the meeting
enlarged by the presence of the eldest Lavater girl,
Dorothea, aged twelve and a half.  Too late they
realised that Dorothea, whom lack of clubs had
kept away from the links, had by the workings of
Anno Domini equalised the vote.
</p>

<p>
With superb self-control and diplomacy worthy
of Whitehall, Mackenzie rose to propose that, in
view of the deadlock, the meeting be postponed to
that day fortnight.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lavater, prompted by a suspicion that
Angus Mackenzie was due to celebrate a thirteenth!
birthday at the beginning of next month, opposed
the amendment on the indisputable grounds that,
before the fortnight was up, the N.C. would have
gone on leave and the doctor would have accompanied
him as far as his tropical disease research
station in the Luangwa Valley.
</p>

<p>
But, suggested Mr. Mackenzie, since the doctor
and the N.C. held opposite opinions on the vexed
question, would they not, so to speak, pair with
each other?
</p>

<p>
'So important a matter,' retorted Mrs. Lavater
with crushing effect, 'must be settled by the whole
community.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On the morning of this eventful day, Matao,
terrified into vigilance by Archie's threat of degradation
and a beating, signalled with a yell of delight
the thin blue smoke of a village hidden behind a
cluster of islets....
</p>

<p>
About the hour that Mrs. Lavater said 'check'
to Mr. Mackenzie's queen, Archie and his followers
pushed on, leaving the village rich in silver, but
emptied of fruit, fish and canoes.  Its young men
had agreed to take them to the south end of the
lake, and as they paddled they sang to keep their
hearts up for the long adventure.
</p>

<p>
The old men and the women remaining in the
village could hear the singing, after the shadow
flung by the chain of islands had swallowed each
canoe that vanished like a water rat, slanting into
the darkness of a hollow bank.  So calm was the
silver water that for a moment the wake of each
boat showed separately, when the hull that had cut
it had gone.
</p>

<p>
In the biggest of the canoes, paddled by a picked
crew in charge of the headman's eldest son, sat
Norah and Archie.
</p>

<p>
'We're all right now,' said Archie.
</p>

<p>
This was as long a sentence as he had uttered
since the night Dick died; and not the violence of
sun and rain beating on her defenceless body, not
the uncertainty and monotony of the food supply,
not the known and unknown dangers of their
position had distressed Norah as much as Archie's
impenetrable reserve.  He did not sulk or ignore her.
He was, she told me, as invariably courteous and
considerate as he would have been to a fellow
passenger in a railway carriage.  And he had saved
her life on the day of the squall.
</p>

<p>
But of what he felt or planned, of regret, fear or
hope, he gave no sign.
</p>

<p>
At first she had sought to bridge the gulf that had
opened between them.  She tried to hint that she
did not hold him answerable for Dick's death: and
once she slipped her hand over his.  But his quick
disengagement from the contact of word or body
would have discouraged one less proud than Norah.
</p>

<p>
'It was as if he was buried along with Dick,' she
said, 'and a foot of earth between us.'
</p>

<p>
Now that it seemed sure that they would reach!
their journey's end, dread of the inquiries that must
there be met, quickened; each sun that rose through
the morning's pale haze of silver and misty blue, to
climb across the scorching firmament of gold and
azure and decline into the tender green and saffron
of a momentary twilight, brought her nearer to
officials, cross-examination and all the paraphernalia of
justice that women hate and distrust.  Each repetition
of the crew's monotonous refrain, each stroke
of the paddles carried her nearer to ... what?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The day the little fleet of canoes, sprinkled on the
face of the great mountain-bound lake like specks
of dust slowly rotating in a basin of water, reached
the southern shores of the lake, I was again in
Abercorn.  By now I had settled into my fishing
camp.  My loads had arrived and Lavater had left
Abercorn on a two days' ulendo into the bush to
inspect the scene of an alleged infanticide.
</p>

<p>
But mail day and Mrs. Lavater's invitation to
lunch brought me into town.  After an excellent
meal Mrs. Lavater's admirable black butler was
handing us coffee on the verandah.  The second nine
holes were temporarily eclipsed by Mrs. Mackenzie's
extravagance.
</p>

<p>
'Crêpe de chine and real Mechlin, my dear,'
announced my hostess.
</p>

<p>
I was not her dear.  That enviable position was
held by the doctor's wife, a tall girl with red hair.
Before her marriage, so Mrs. Lavater had informed
me, she was a professional pianist.  Whether in
cinemas or the Queen's Hall, I had no means of
telling.  On the same authority she was to have a
baby in March.
</p>

<p>
She now expressed no wonder at the richness of
Mrs. Mackenzie's underlinen and indicated that,
from the prices charged at her husband's store, it
might well be sewn with diamonds....
</p>

<p>
'Who can that be on the road?' interrupted Mrs. Lavater.
</p>

<p>
We turned and stared down the road which, leading
to the lake, runs straight for a mile or more
outside the township.  As the white man in ragged
khaki, with a gun bearer at his heels, came near, to
my surprise I recognised Archie.
</p>

<p>
'Do you know Captain Sinclair well?' I was asked
when the first flood of conjecture had abated.
</p>

<p>
'I doubt if any one does,' was my reply, which,
in my own mind, included his wife.
</p>

<p>
'Of course he's very nice,' said the red-haired girl,
staring up the road, 'but don't you find him just a
little bit dull?  Now she's such a lively little thing.'
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lavater contributed the inevitable platitude
about opposites.
</p>

<p>
'His marriage must have been the adventure of
his life,' persisted the other.  'You can't imagine
anything much happening to Mr. Sinclair.'
</p>

<p>
The unromantic object of our interest was now
nearly within hail.  I noticed that he walked like a
tired or an old man.
</p>

<p>
A gang of native prisoners were sweeping the
footpath at the cross roads.  The black policeman who
guarded them stood to attention and saluted.
Archie seemed to hesitate before he returned the
salute.  He paused for a moment, as if uncertain
whether to come up to the verandah.  At last he
turned and made for the business part of the township.
</p>

<p>
'Where's he off to?' asked Mrs. Lavater, disappointed,
I thought, that another should have first
pull at the news.  'He'll be here in a minute,' she
consoled herself.
</p>

<p>
But minutes passed and Archie did not come.
For some imprecise reason faintly uneasy, I made
an excuse to follow him.  Passing the little group
of red brick houses with their shady balconies and
luxuriant pergolas, their tidy English beds of roses
and carnations, I came to the trading store.
Mackenzie was stock-taking.
</p>

<p>
'And three dozen is six hundred,' he said as I
entered.
</p>

<p>
'Pleased to see you, Mr. Ross ... would you
believe it, the ladies call these cups too dear at
eleven pence!  I give you my word they cost me
ninepence and a fraction landed here, and that's
without breakages or overhead charges.'
</p>

<p>
I sympathised and, as soon as I could, I asked if
Sinclair had been there.
</p>

<p>
'It's not ten minutes since he got up from that
chair,' I was told.  'He looked as if he needed a
chair too.'
</p>

<p>
Mackenzie did not think it was fever.  If it was,
he'd never seen a go like it.  Archie looked 'all
endwise,' he said, and added that he hadn't seemed
to know whether he was coming or going.  He had
stared at Mackenzie quite queerly when he told
him about the golf-course scandal.  But he was
plainly glad to see the case of ammunition that was
waiting for him in the meal store.  He brought two
rounds out of his pocket which he said were his last.
Then he had gone to the shelves and ordered tinned
fruit and vegetables by the dozen.
</p>

<p>
I interrupted to ask for news of Norah.
</p>

<p>
'I inquired after his lady,' said Mackenzie, 'but
the Captain never seemed to hear me.'  With
national readiness to anticipate the worst, he added
that he would be sorry if everything was not well
there.
</p>

<p>
'If you're wanting to see him yourself,' he ended,
'you've only got to step round to the post office.
He said he must send a wire to Kigoma about the
<i>Mimi</i>&mdash;you'll find him with Hume.'
</p>

<p>
But I did not.  He had gone, said Hume, in the
direction of the D.C.'s office.  Hume too remarked
how ill he looked.  Fever, he diagnosed, and a bad
go at that, although Sinclair had insisted that
nothing was wrong.
</p>

<p>
Besides his mail&mdash;several weeks' accumulation of
letters and newspapers&mdash;there had been a cable for
him.
</p>

<p>
'You'd have thought it was bad news,' said
Hume, 'the way he read it.  As a matter of fact&mdash;I
oughtn't to tell you, only I know it won't go any
further&mdash;it was an Elizabethville cable confirming
the purchase of Captain Sinclair's whole herd, at a
big price too.'
</p>

<p>
But Archie had stared at the message, said Hume,
as if it did not make sense.  Then he'd laughed 'an
odd kind of laugh' and torn the form to little bits.
The pieces lay there still.
</p>

<p>
As I followed Archie to the Boma, I could not
help wondering what had happened to this
self-possessed Scot.  I could hardly guess that in full
Byronic blast that morning he had breasted the
hill to Abercorn with the pride of Manfred or Cain
in his heart.  And now the well-kept roads, the grip
of Mackenzie's industrious hand, the news of the
great golf scandal&mdash;all this shouted at him that, in
the well-padded hold of civilisation, Cain becomes
Crippen.
</p>

<p>
I knocked at the door of the D.C.'s office.  Joseph,
the native clerk, immaculate in white duck and a
black tarboosh, admitted me.  The office was as
spotless as its sole occupant&mdash;bundles of documents
tied with tape, trays full of letters, rows of files, all
the paraphernalia of administration.
</p>

<p>
The Bwana, said Joseph, had gone away after
hearing that Bwana La-va-ta was on ulendo and that
Bwana Jo-ne-si (Jones was the name of the Native
Commissioner) had gone to England.
</p>

<p>
As I left the block of offices, I saw Foster, the
A.N.C., with a crowd of black men on his verandah.
His position in a deck chair, flanked by blue and
red clad messengers and surrounded by an irregular
circle of silent natives, indicated that a lawsuit was
in progress.  He appeared to ask a question and a
native in the front of the circle, without moving
his body or head, loosed a spate of words.
</p>

<p>
I listened, waiting my chance to ask Foster which
road Archie had taken.  A <i>cause célèbre</i> seemed to
be in process.  Tungati, an obese elder of Malekani's
village, had followed King David's example in taking
a third wife to comfort his age.  The experiment
had been a success, until a stranger from
Kachilikila's ... A pause in the evidence enabled me to
ask my question.
</p>

<p>
'Left a minute ago,' replied Foster, 'went towards
Lavater's house by the back way.  He stood and
watched these blighters for ten minutes.  Looked
as sick as mud.  You'd think it was his wife instead
of Tungati's,' added the irreverent youth.
</p>

<p>
When I had closed my fruitless circle, Archie was
already installed on the verandah of the D.C.'s
house and Mrs. Lavater was making tea.  As I
walked up, I saw his illness had not been
exaggerated.  But while I shook hands, I wondered if
health alone explained the sunken cheeks, the skin
grey in spite of the sun, the dead eyes.  He seemed
stricken yet defiant: burnt out, but the ashes were
hot.
</p>

<p>
Mrs. Lavater was pressing him to stay to dinner;
but Norah, he said, was alone in camp ten miles out
of the township ... yes, they had come off the
lake that morning ... no, they hadn't come on the
<i>Mimi</i> ... no, canoes ... yes, it had been hot
... yes, the rains hadn't helped....
</p>

<p>
I took no part in the cross-examination.  If Archie
was more than usually taciturn, there was something,
no doubt, which he did not want to discuss.  The
same reasoning urged the ladies to fresh efforts.  But
their bag was meagre.  Like the poet, they failed to
elicit whence he had come, or whither going.  At
last a reply that roused Mrs. Lavater's hospitable
instincts checked the hunt.  Leaving us together,
she went to see that milk and butter from the Boma
herd, vegetables from her garden and eggs from her
yard were sent off at once to Norah.  The doctor's
wife went with her.
</p>

<p>
To break the silence that followed their
withdrawal, 'Lavater's expected back to-morrow,' I
remarked.
</p>

<p>
My very ordinary words seemed to send a wave
of emotion across Archie's face.  Relief at first he
seemed to feel, satisfaction almost.  Then the slight
smile faded, and a barely perceptible frown of
anxiety or defiance settled on his features.
</p>

<p>
'So soon,' he said quietly.
</p>

<p>
His mood puzzled me.  I had always liked Archie.
There was something extremely lovable in his almost
truculent sincerity.  He was so straight; you knew
where you were with him.  But to-day a shadow
stood between us.  I didn't know in the least where
I was.
</p>

<p>
He plainly did not want to talk and I suggested
that he must be anxious to open the mail he held
under his arm.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at the handwriting on the envelopes
and pushed them into his pocket.  Then he ripped
off the wrapper of a newspaper.  Indifferently he
turned the leaves, till he seemed to come to something
that interested him.  In the silence that followed,
I tried to analyse the strangeness of Archie's
manner.
</p>

<p>
That faintly defiant jerk of his head.  What did
it defy?  That vaguely puzzled look, as if he tried
to grasp at a word whose syllables danced in the
recesses of his brain, or struggled to locate some
indistinct smell.  What was eluding him?
</p>

<p>
My thoughts were interrupted by the swish of
the newspaper falling from his fingers.  My eye
caught the headlines of the open page as it fluttered
to the ground.  They dealt with the bellicose
caperings of Monsieur Poincaré and with the latest
murder trial that was quickening the pulses of the
great British public.  I glanced up at Archie's grey
face.  It was no longer puzzled.  He had found
the word he sought.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
And when he had gone, 'Don't you agree now,'
said the red-haired girl, 'that Captain Sinclair is a
tiny bit dull?'"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II
</h3>

<p>
Within forty-eight hours, some of the
questions I had asked myself on Mrs. Lavater's
verandah were answered.
</p>

<p>
I had finished breakfast and with the help of my
fishing fundi was putting a patch on the elder of
my canoes, when I heard a voice.  Even if the
Sinclairs had not been on my mind, I would have
recognised Norah's deep tones.  I rose from my
work, feeling after some passable excuse for having
failed to visit their camp half a dozen miles away.
My true reason had been an instinctive shrinking
from other people's troubles.
</p>

<p>
But my first sight of Norah told me that forms
might be forgotten.  Her eyes, that the lamp of
romance had once lit, now were dark with pain.
Was it possible, you wondered, that they had ever
laughed?  Had even cried?  Without suffering the
decay of age, she had lost her youth.  The wing of
death, you guessed, was between her and the sun.
Infinitely remote from her seemed the life that the
rains set pulsing through each leaf, each blade of
grass.  She noticed nothing of the beauty that
surrounded her, the shouts of green that the trees set
up, the blue eye of the lake looking along the glade
my carriers had cut.  Her eyes were turned inwards
on some private hell whose key lay in her bosom.
</p>

<p>
Her first words were banal enough.  Some
apology for intrusion that I waved away.  My
reply, inevitably trivial, sounded flippant in the
face of her manifest grief and I subsided into an
awkward silence.
</p>

<p>
Archie was ill, went on the low voice, and their
quinine was finished: she had wondered...
</p>

<p>
By the time I returned with the bottle, I fancy
she had decided to consult me.
</p>

<p>
The words came jostling each other&mdash;Archie was
delirious; the doctor was away from Abercorn; the
Kasama man would take a week to get here; and
anyhow ... She did not complete the sentence.
He had never been so bad as this; but the strain
of the last week&mdash;was it blackwater, did I think?
And ... and they had come from the sleeping
sickness belt, could it be...?
</p>

<p>
She refused food, and when I had given my medicine
chest to my fundi to carry, we set out along a
native path in the direction she had come.  Her
obvious gratitude to me for coming was surprising.
So pretty a woman is rarely grateful.  Men are too
ready to help without.
</p>

<p>
To cut short her thanks, I inquired about Archie's
symptoms and was able to assure her that the fever
was not blackwater.  And certainly not a forerunner
of sleeping sickness.  I was prepared to notice that
my words brought little relief.  A husband delirious
in the bush might send a woman wild with anxiety,
might drive her to the brink of panic, it would not
explain the hopelessness in Norah's eyes and mouth.
</p>

<p>
I felt a wave of pity.  She was too slim a little
thing for this burden, whatever it was.  In violence
to my principles I asked if I could help.
</p>

<p>
'I don't think anything can help now,' she
whispered, and so low that I had to read her lips.
'Archie has killed ... some one.'"
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I was not particularly shocked," said Ross.  "All
this feeling against straightforward assassination is
quite modern.
</p>

<p>
You must discriminate, of course, between honest
killing and surreptitious murder.  There has always
been a prejudice against that.  The Borgias, for
instance, have found critics in every century, and
until recent, sentimental years we burnt wives who
poisoned their husbands.  But an honourable
assassination, under guises which varied from the
ceremonial of mediæval tournament to the violence
of renaissance vendetta, and on to the more polished
formulæ of the duel, has lasted almost to our day.
</p>

<p>
With the duel passed the power to punish certain
private injuries for which the law furnishes no
redress.  And in fault of any regular outlet, the
man with strong feelings and a literal mind has to
fall back on murder."
</p>

<p>
Ross spoke with vehemence.  Did his earnestness,
I wondered, throw any light on his own mysterious
past?  As if he read some shadow of the suspicion
on my face, he came back abruptly to the Sinclairs.
</p>

<p>
"That was how I came to hear Norah's story,"
he said.  "Not in the detail I have given you, nor
in the order.  But by the time we were half-way to
Archie's camp she had given me a clear enough
outline.
</p>

<p>
I suggested that she had exaggerated the danger.
We would have to nurse Archie ourselves and keep
outsiders away till he was clear of delirium.  And
the natives, even if they suspected anything, would
keep quiet.  They do not like Bomas, I said and
enlarged on the discretion of Africa.
</p>

<p>
She signed to me to stop.
</p>

<p>
'It's past that now,' she said.  'I haven't told you
the end.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Archie's visit to Abercorn had been paid with the
object of reporting Dick's death to the Boma.  So
much information he had given Norah before he
started up the hill, repeating the story he had told
the natives on the night of the crime.
</p>

<p>
Her heart had ached to help him.  If only he
would let her be of some use, go with him and
perjure herself for his sake.  Fiercely she longed to
save him, to avert the ultimate consequences of the
havoc she had loosed.  But with conventional words
of leave-taking, Archie, followed by his gun-bearer,
went up the road.
</p>

<p>
She took what comfort she could, remembering the
efficiency he had shown throughout.  If, thought
she, her husband could cope with Lake Tanganyika,
she need not doubt his dealings with the Boma.  In
which conclusion, she allowed him a woman's
strength.  When, at the beginning of this story, I
tried to show you Norah, I spoke of the small cat
house.  Now cats, and women, do not herd.  The
hand they play is a lone one whether in Malay or
Mayfair, and the war they wage with law, rules of
conduct, codes of honour, is age old.
</p>

<p>
But men, and the animals that chew the cud,
have the herd instinct.  They see the value of
solidarity and are glad to submit their wills to the
herd.  Until suffragettes were vouchsafed us, no
Englishman had ever guessed that it was unnecessary
to obey the law.  Occasionally life, or the workings
of his own heart, drive a man or a bull or a ram
away from the herd.  Once isolated he acts with
more enterprise and vigour than any of the feline
family, however used to solitude.
</p>

<p>
Sighted again, the herd reclaims him.
</p>

<p>
So Archie came back that night from Abercorn a
changed man.  The hard outline which had seemed
to bound his thinking, like the lead round a figure
in stained glass, had melted.  He was weaker, more
human: something of his old indecision had returned.
Uneasily he paced the camp.
</p>

<p>
In silence Norah wondered.  The senior officials,
he had said, were away from the Boma and he had
returned, his story untold.  But relief or suspense,
she knew, could not explain this change.  Under her
eyelashes all evening she watched him and sought
in vain for some word that might allay his trouble.
Throughout the night she heard the camp bed creak
under his restless body.
</p>

<p>
Was it then that he was first aware of his
fellowship with the men whose names shame alone
preserves when quicklime has consumed their bodies?
Did Dick's eyes again look pitifully into the muzzle
of his .420?  Did he strive once more to straighten
the stiffened limbs and push the contorted body
sideways into the wet grave?  There can, I suppose, be
little sleep on the first night you see yourself a
murderer.
</p>

<p>
In the morning a glance told Norah that the fever,
which had fantastically vanished after the rains had
drenched him to the skin, was back.  He sat huddled
over the camp fire, only moving to call for logs.  She
urged him to return to bed, but he shook his head.
He refused luncheon, and sat with pen and paper
before him.  Then he began to write.  His hand
shook with fever, but he wrote fairly quickly.  He
covered three sheets and addressed an envelope for
each.
</p>

<p>
Still crouching over the fire, 'Norah,' he said, 'I
think I ought to give it you to read.'
</p>

<p>
His tone told her she must brace herself for a
shock.
</p>

<p>
'They won't bother you, I hope,' he went on, 'I've
tried to make it all right for you.'  He kept his eyes
turned away from her, but his voice was more kind.
His hand, which trembled a little, played with the
letters on the table.
</p>

<p>
'This,' he continued, 'is to the solicitors.  About
the farm, the sale of the stock and so on.  This,'
he touched the second letter, 'is my will.  Of course
everything goes to you.'
</p>

<p>
He paused and, drawing the last document from
its envelope, he handed it to Norah.
</p>

<p>
She forced herself to read, though her mind was
too busy with his words to take in the symbols before
her eyes.  Suddenly, as if a blade of ice had been
driven between her shoulders, she understood.
</p>

<p>
The letter was addressed to the District Commissioner,
Abercorn, and began and ended officially
enough, 'Sir, I have the honour to report ... I
have the honour to be, Sir, your obedient servant,
A. L. Sinclair.'
</p>

<p>
Between the formulæ, ran a story designed to
shield her and convict himself.  He wrote that
Ward, at his request, had been escorting Norah to
Kigoma.  They were all to meet there.  The <i>Mimi</i>
broke down, but chance united them in the bay of
the deserted mission.  On the evening of the 25th
he had gone out shooting with Ward.  Their tempers
had suffered from the heat.  He had complained of
Ward's over-liberal expenditure of ammunition,
which was then short.  A quarrel had ensued and he
had shot Ward through the heart.  With legal
forethought he gave the exact position of the grave that
the body might be identified and death established.
</p>

<p>
She read the bald story word by word to its end.
</p>

<p>
'For God's sake, Archie,' she asked him, although
she knew his answer only too well, 'what are you
going to do with this?'
</p>

<p>
He said that Matao must take it to Abercorn.  His
fever would not let him walk so far.  He muttered
something about feeling clean again.
</p>

<p>
'Don't, Archie, don't!  Give it back to me!'  Her
voice made the natives break off their occupations
and stare at the eccentricities of the white man.  He
looked in her face as if her eyes could show him her
soul.  Then he turned away shaking his head.
</p>

<p>
'But you've got fever,' she urged, 'you don't know
what you're doing.  Write what you were going to
say yesterday.'
</p>

<p>
For answer he called Matao.
</p>

<p>
'One can pay too much, just to live,' he murmured.
</p>

<p>
'At least wait.  Think it over in cold blood.  Wait
a day, one day.'
</p>

<p>
Lavater, he replied, came back that afternoon.
The death would have to be reported at once, one
version or the other.  He now knew which version
it must be.
</p>

<p>
A fog seemed to spring up from below, over her
eyes.  She would have thrown herself at his feet if
Matao had not stood gravely waiting.
</p>

<p>
'For my sake then, Archie!'
</p>

<p>
'How should I know,' he said looking away from
her.  'How should I know that this time too...?'
</p>

<p>
He felt the harshness of his words and let them
die away.
</p>

<p>
'Matao,' he said quickly, his voice rough in his
throat.  'Take this to Bwana Lavater at his office.
The sun will have set before you arrive.  Sleep at
M'pala and return in the morning.'
</p>

<p>
Norah saw Matao salute and swing round.  She
did not see him disappear into the trees, for she had
fainted."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III
</h3>

<p>
Archie, when we reached his camp, was lying
on his back with open eyes that saw nothing
visible to us.  The bedclothes were in a heap on the
ground and he resisted Norah when she replaced
them.  Except that his head rolled heavily from side
to side, I had no difficulty in taking his temperature.
It was 104°.
</p>

<p>
Norah said that at about midnight she had heard
him muttering.  He did not know her, though she
sat by his side for the rest of the night, keeping the
clothes on his tossing limbs.  Sometimes she had had
to hold him down, for he shouted that he must see
Lavater at once and struggled to rise.
</p>

<p>
I asked if the D.C. had had the fatal letter.
Public morality might demand that Archie should be
nursed to life to be turned over to the hangman.
But putting friendship before morals, it seemed to
me that he might be allowed to die, if not quietly,
at least in his bed.
</p>

<p>
Norah's hands were clenched and white, while
Matao was spinning his rigmarole.
</p>

<p>
'Then Bwana Lavater is not back?' she asked at
the end, 'what did you do with the letter?'
</p>

<p>
Joseph, the D.C.'s clerk, had promised he would
give it to the D.C. as soon as he came back.  Joseph
was an Angoni, said Matao, and all Angoni are
liars; but he had not left the office until he had
seen the letter laid on Bwana La-va-ta's big table.
</p>

<p>
So the confession lay unread: there was hope,
then, and Archie's life was still worth saving.  I
felt that I could not leave Norah, whose nerves had
been strained to the fainting point, unaided to nurse
him, and I sent my fundi back with orders to strike
camp and bring on carriers and loads.
</p>

<p>
I looked round for a bit of level ground for my
camp.  Archie, with an eye to the comfort of his
much-enduring carriers, had pitched his tent on the
outskirts of the first village he had come to on his
way up from the lake.  The ground was a net-work
of little obstructed paths, trodden between the raised
beds which make an African village garden resemble
a pauper cemetery of circular graves.  The green
of ground nuts, cassava, gourds and beans, straggled
sparsely over the mounds.  High, splintery, black
stumps showed where the trees had been lopped, two
or three feet from the ground, and burnt to enrich
the soil with their potash.  Only the biggest trunks,
that had been too much trouble to cut, remained.
</p>

<p>
Meaning to ask in the village for a guide to show
me a more shady and level spot, I penetrated the
squalid cluster of dilapidated mud huts.  The
villagers, I found, were absent at work, no doubt in
distant gardens.  One old woman, the headman's
eldest wife I guessed her to be, sat under the untidy
overhang of her thatched roof.  Her stomach was
enormous; on her head she wore a tan-coloured wig
made of puku skin.  She bent forward and clapped
her hands in salutation, but she was too shy to
answer my question.
</p>

<p>
Beyond the village I found the twenty-foot road
that the last D.C. had cut through the forest to
connect Abercorn with the lake.  Its earth surface was
deeply scored by ruts which the occasional
ox-wagons that carried freight to the <i>Mimi</i> had cut.
Rain had poured down the channels, scouring them
till the white roots showed.  A path, trodden hard
by bare feet, straggled from side to side of the road,
and down its centre a bicycle had marked its track
on the wet earth.
</p>

<p>
As I chose my site, what a chance, I reflected,
for any one with a taste for allegory!  Side by side,
the pathetic makeshift of the savage and the
masterful puerility of the European, on a background of
bottomless lake, immemorial hill, interminable
forest.  Which in the history of the globe would
prevail?
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The first hour of my vigil by Archie's bed passed
in silence.  The African day is so much quieter than
the night.  Some insect humming, a bird calling....
From time to time I moistened Archie's dry
lips or arranged his disordered bed.
</p>

<p>
I had gone outside for a drink of tea when his
voice recalled me.  It was not me he called, but a
bombardier who had been killed at his side six years
before in Flanders.  I sat by him while he revisited
all his life's hours of stress.  Now shells were
dropping on his O.P. at Armentières; now the
hump-backed African oxen jibbed in the plough or the
brick-makers let the kiln fires go out; in the
Carpathian darkness with his dying men he waited for
the Austrians; or his hoe struck rock before Dick's
grave was deep enough.
</p>

<p>
And through it all ran his love for Norah, like the
theme of a fugue or the thread on which a rosary
of pain was strung.
</p>

<p>
As the day wore on, his earlier memories were
blocked by the horror of the last fortnight.  I felt
no shame at eavesdropping on his soul.  To save
him, I must gauge the malady of mind, as well as
body.
</p>

<p>
So, during days and nights of delirium, I pieced
together some sequence of what Archie had suffered
on the shores of Tanganyika.  It was screamed at
me in oaths and prayers; whispered in obscene
words; veiled in symbolism of delirium.  With foul
names he assailed the woman of his life; with
writhing fingers he tore at Dick's throat; hyænas with
blind eyes swarmed on to the rafts; the lake changed
from azure to blood; Dick grinned on the ground
by the filled-in grave and Norah screamed under the
wet earth....
</p>

<p>
From the insane medley, one clear fact emerged.
Archie was racked, less by his guilt than his love.
The shadow, not of his crime, but of something that
Norah had done, pursued him inexorably.  One
phrase again and again seemed to burst, rather from
his chest, than from his cracking lips.
</p>

<p>
'Norah, why did you? ... Norah, why did you?'
</p>

<p>
When night fell, his cries sank to a murmur that,
by the time Norah came to relieve me, had yielded
to sleep.
</p>

<p>
'Is he going to live?' were her first words.
</p>

<p>
'Does he want to?' I countered, 'do <i>you</i> want
him to?'
</p>

<p>
Her grave eyes considered me.
</p>

<p>
'Is that how I appear to you?' she said at last.
</p>

<p>
'I'm neutral by creed,' I answered, 'but you don't
understand me.  Do you want him to live ... for
what awaits him?'
</p>

<p>
'It mustn't,' she stammered a little in her
eagerness, 'we must save him.'
</p>

<p>
'From himself then,' I added, without her confidence.
Then as she did not reply, 'It isn't the police
we've got to fear, it's his own despair.'
</p>

<p>
'Because he feels he's a murderer?'
</p>

<p>
'Partly.'
</p>

<p>
'And&mdash;&mdash;?'
</p>

<p>
'Because his heart's dead.'
</p>

<p>
She lifted her head to say that she must undo
what she had done.  I wondered how far that can
ever be effected.  Some gesture must have revealed
my doubt.
</p>

<p>
'You think I can't,' she said, 'and you don't know
how much there is to undo.  I haven't told you....'
</p>

<p>
Thus began the re-telling of her tragic story,
partly I fancy, to ease the load that lay so heavy
on her heart, partly to track down some clue that
might yet save Archie.
</p>

<p>
On ran her narrative, when neither Archie's needs
nor our own desire for sleep took precedence, during
the seventy-two hours of his illness.  It was not
now the naked bones of the tragedy that she showed
me.  In her search for any word and moment in the
tragedy that might throw light on the dark places
of Archie's heart, she laid bare before my eyes, that
were at least pitiful, all she had seen, imagined,
suffered.
</p>

<p>
By the second midnight, when Archie was quiet
and we sat together by the fire, the story had wound
its indirect way as far as her promise to renounce
Dick and return to her husband.
</p>

<p>
'And then he found Dick kissing me!' she cried
in a strained voice.  'No wonder if...' she lapsed
into silence, staring into the fire with eyes that
watching had sunk deep.  Presently she turned her
head aside and I guessed she was crying.
</p>

<p>
'Wasn't it that kiss that killed his heart?' she
asked at last.
</p>

<p>
Snatches of raving rang in my ears as I shrugged
my shoulders.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to gather herself together.  'I'll bring
it back to life,' she said.
</p>

<p>
Then, as if she read scepticism in my silence,
'I'm not pretending to you&mdash;I've told you too
much&mdash;that I love Archie as once I did.  Nor will I
pretend with Archie.  He'd see through me, suffering
sharpens the eyes.  But...' she stood up and,
for the first time since she had sought me, I had a
girl before me, 'I can and will prove I'm not what
I've let him think.'
</p>

<p>
'What Archie pursues,' I said rather pompously,
'and in himself achieves is loyalty, cleanness....'
</p>

<p>
'While I'm unloyal, dirtied,' she broke in.  'Yes,
I am.  But I'll show him my ideals are his.'
</p>

<p>
Her voice broke a little and flattened.  'Yes,
you're right, what is the good of ideals one throws
on the scrap heap?  But I'll serve him, cherish him....
Though I can't love him with passion, if only
he can love me again, I'll serve him honestly for
better or for worse, till death....'
</p>

<p>
I suppose my instinctive mistrust of promises led
me to point out that that parting was not likely to
be remote unless&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Unless?' she asked and repeated, 'I'll save him.
I will save him.'
</p>

<p>
'You've got to save him from two dangers.'
</p>

<p>
'For heaven's sake don't speak in riddles,' she
said, her nerves on edge.
</p>

<p>
'From himself and from the herd.'
</p>

<p>
'You think that even if he...' she hesitated,
'even if I can make him believe I'm worth his love,
he'll still give himself up?'
</p>

<p>
I nodded, 'And his confession is on the D.C.'s
desk.'
</p>

<p>
She seemed to brush this aside.  'Why can't he
see it as I do?' she cried.  'A nightmare to be
forgotten, if we can.  Not to sacrifice to.  He was mad
at the time, mad with jealousy and fever.  Why
should his life be thrown after Dick's?'
</p>

<p>
It takes a woman to reach these heights of common
sense.  Conscience is the curse of Adam; while Eve's
punishment, if I remember right, was nothing less
practical than the pangs of child-birth and a dread
of snakes.
</p>

<p>
And if women have no consciences, I reflected,
neither do they admit any debt to society.  They
are free lances, privateers: if they and their men
are safe, society can fend for itself.  But I did not
speak my thoughts, as Norah sat down again and
in the low, even voice of one who thinks aloud,
resumed her story.
</p>

<p>
Again she described the last meeting she was to
have with Dick on earth, again his arms clutched
her immobile body, as Archie and his rifle emerged
from the shadow of the ruined tower.  So vivid were
her words, I felt I was an eyewitness: I saw Dick
start up; the barrel of the .420 wavered from
Norah's breast to his; he fumbled with his gun....
</p>

<p>
The dusky voice had stopped in the middle of a
word.  I looked round to see what had interrupted
her.
</p>

<p>
The natives detailed to tend the fire slept soundlessly
at our feet, nothing stirred in the circle of the
fire, there was even a lull in the noises of the night.
Norah was staring straight in front of her and I
understood that it was something her mind had seen
that had arrested her.
</p>

<p>
'I'll do it,' she murmured, 'I can do it.  I'm
strong enough.'
</p>

<p>
And strong she looked.  Despair had dropped
from her like a garment, her face shone with courage.
So must Kate Douglas have looked, who thrust her
arm through the empty staples to bar the door,
behind which whispered the murderers of her king.
</p>

<p>
So, her dark eyes moist but triumphant, must
Norah Cleverly have looked the night in the Carpathians
she saved the life she was so nearly to spoil.
</p>

<p>
In turns we watched, made plans and slept, until,
about three next afternoon, Archie's temperature
subsided and he fell into a quiet sleep.
</p>

<p>
Norah stood looking at the thin face.  Then she
drew me out of the tent.  Did I think it safe for
her to leave him for the afternoon, she asked?  I
must have looked astonished, for she laughed and
said she was going into Abercorn.
</p>

<p>
It would be dark, I objected, by the time she got
there.
</p>

<p>
'The darker the better,' she replied, still laughing.
</p>

<p>
I wondered if relief had made her hysterical; a
queer exhilarated light shone in her dark eyes; there
was something at once fey and fanatical about her.
The pythoness at the oracle, the martyr at the stake
must have had, I imagined, such eyes.  Under the
power of the inspiration, whatever it was, her beauty
had bloomed again, like Africa when the rains have
come.
</p>

<p>
But even so it seemed no reason to be caught by
the fall of night on a motiveless walk to Abercorn.
I said so.
</p>

<p>
She promised to take Changalilo, a gun and a
hurricane lamp.
</p>

<p>
I said bluntly I could not see why she wanted to
go.  She became serious.
</p>

<p>
'I'm going to see Mr. Lavater,' she said.
</p>

<p>
I raised my eyebrows.
</p>

<p>
'What's the good?' I asked, 'what are you going
to say?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know yet.  It depends on him.'
</p>

<p>
'But you must have some plan!'
</p>

<p>
'Do they listen to confessions made in delirium?'
</p>

<p>
'Will Lavater believe it was?'
</p>

<p>
'Why not?'
</p>

<p>
I pointed out that he would come to see Archie
as soon as he was convalescent ... and hear a
repetition of the same confession.  We both knew
Archie's obstinacy.
</p>

<p>
If he does, if I can't make Archie change,' she
looked up quickly, 'I'll swear on the Bible it was
I that killed Dick.'
</p>

<p>
Woman, the greatest egoist of created beings ... and
the most selfless!  I looked at Norah with
admiration.  When she gave, she gave herself.  But
I admired her courage more than her sense.
</p>

<p>
'And Archie will swear on another Bible, that <i>he</i>
did it,' I objected.
</p>

<p>
'He may; they can't hang us both,' she said with
triumphant logic.
</p>

<p>
What evidence was there, she insisted, to support
either story?  Why should they believe Archie
before her?
</p>

<p>
I held my tongue.  Unless the prosecuting counsel
was a fool, I was sure that he would turn her story
inside out.  The elopement would be dragged to
light and every presumption of motive would point
to Archie's guilt.  True that was not evidence, but
what seemed to me to stamp with futility any
struggle or shift of Norah's, was Archie's own soul
as his ravings had revealed it.  He saw himself a
murderer, his wife a treacherous wanton.  If Norah's
subterfuge saved his life from the hands of the Law,
could she secure it from his own?
</p>

<p>
I hesitated.  In spite of post-war philosophy,
courage seems to me admirable and rare enough.
But to win, she must face issues.
</p>

<p>
I hinted my doubts.
</p>

<p>
'I know,' she said, 'I know all that.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When I came back from escorting her as far as
the road, Archie was awake.
</p>

<p>
He smiled weakly and tried to greet me, but his
voice was inaudible.  He was glad to obey me and
lie quiet, though his eyes wandered in search of
Norah.
</p>

<p>
'She's sleeping,' I lied, wishing to keep Abercorn
and what it held out of his thoughts.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV
</h3>

<p>
Archie's convalescence was rapid; within a
week he was well enough to receive a visitor.
During the days of his recovery I had come to
know him better than ever before.  The strangeness
or remoteness I had sensed in him at Abercorn had
gone.  He was gentle and grateful for little things.
I found him very human, and, since humanity is
tragic, rather touching.  He seemed to have won
the sad tranquillity of old people on fine days.  One
could not grudge him a peace he had bought, he
believed, at the price of his life or freedom.
</p>

<p>
He sat wrapped up, savouring the warmth of
the sun, watching the natives at their trivial and
absorbing occupations, inhaling as it were the beauty
and activity of the world.  And counting, I could
not help imagining, the hours that remained for its
enjoyment.  Partly to escape such disquieting
thoughts, partly to make Archie dependent on
Norah and to draw him to her, I spent most of the
day in my own camp.
</p>

<p>
His first visitor came to me, in my capacity of
medical adviser, for permission to pay a call.
</p>

<p>
As I issued from the semi-darkness of my tent
into the mellow sunlight of the late afternoon, I
found him squatting in the shadow.  The sunlight
sliding through the trees that had been thinned
by the needs of the villagers, fell on his wrinkled
face and made him pucker his patient eyes.  I
recognised Ntula, the headman of the village against
which we had camped.
</p>

<p>
Arranging the folds of the faded purple cloth that
draped his emaciated limbs, he lay back on the
ground and, with the courtesy of the old school,
clapped his hands behind his head.  Invoking peace
on him and his village, I asked what he wished.
</p>

<p>
He had brought, he said, these unimportant
presents&mdash;the little meal that famine among his
people permitted, the handful of eggs that the hens
would lay in the time of rain and a few chickens
that had escaped the hawks.
</p>

<p>
He waved his hand towards the deeper shadow
where I could imperfectly see the outline of the old
lady with the puku skin wig, mounting guard over
a flat basket of meal and a bundle of squawking
fowls, tied together by the legs.
</p>

<p>
These, Ntula continued, he wished to take to the
Bwana, whom the hand of Death had spared.
</p>

<p>
Pondering the cause of this deference, I led the
old diplomat to Archie's camp, his obese consort
following with a perfectly naked daughter of six,
who carried a minute basket of eggs on her
graceful head.
</p>

<p>
I found Archie in his usual place and ready to
see the old man.  He expected, he said, that some
complaint against the conduct of his Wemba carriers
prompted this visit of ceremony.
</p>

<p>
Ntula repeated his compliments, while his wife
and daughter knelt behind the presents, clapping
their hands.  Archie expressed his thanks and sent
Matao to find calico and salt for the return gifts.
</p>

<p>
Polite conversation proceeded, volubly on the
headman's part, monosyllabically on Archie's.
</p>

<p>
At length when the course of the rains, the
prospect of the crops and the abundance of game had
been passed in review, there came a pause.  Was
there anything, asked Archie, that he could do for
his visitor?  The headman appeared pained at the
idea.  He had come, he repeated, to announce his
satisfaction at the chief's recovery from grave
sickness....  But since the chief suggested it, if it
so happened that one day he saw Bwana La-va-ta...
</p>

<p>
'Is Bwana Lavater back at M'pala?'[<a id="chap0304fn1text"></a><a href="#chap0304fn1">1</a>] asked
Archie quickly.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap0304fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap0304fn1text">1</a>] M'pala is the native name for Abercorn.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ntula replied that his eldest son had seen Bwana
La-va-ta bicycling into Abercorn as it grew dark.
Now should the chief happen to speak to...
</p>

<p>
'How long ago was that?' said Archie.
</p>

<p>
It was the evening of the day that the zebra had
eaten the young mealies in his nephew Chisulo's
garden ... well, that was five days ago.
</p>

<p>
'The evening I got better,' calculated Archie.
'Are you sure?' he asked, and the old man became
courteously emphatic.
</p>

<p>
'Well,' said Archie, anxious for the visit to end,
'if I see Bwana Lavater...?'
</p>

<p>
We came circuitously to the point.  It appeared
that Ntula owed tax for himself and three wives,
ten shillings a head, not only for the current year,
but also for the last.  And the Boma was putting
men who did not pay their taxes in chains.  If the
chief would one day condescend to look at his
gardens and his village, and see how poor the soil
and how few the men, perhaps he could persuade
Bwana Lavater....
</p>

<p>
Archie for all his stoicism winced.  He leant
forward and spoke to me in English.  'It wouldn't
be much use <i>my</i> speaking to the Boma.  May I
tell the old man you'll try?'
</p>

<p>
I nodded and Ntula withdrew, with manifold
expressions of pleasure at Archie's recovery and
gratitude for his promise.
</p>

<p>
Archie sat down by the fire.  Changalilo was on
his knees blowing the embers into flame.
</p>

<p>
'If Lavater has been back in Abercorn for five
days,' said Archie, 'something must have happened
to my letter.'
</p>

<p>
I urged him to return to bed as night was at
hand.  He did not seem to hear me.  Presently he
announced that he would have a machila made the
next day and be carried up to Abercorn in the
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
'It's no use waiting,' he added.
</p>

<p>
The moment, I felt, was critical; once Archie
made up his mind nothing would stop him.  I turned
my head and succeeded in catching Norah's eye.
She was preparing invalid's food in the camp
kitchen.
</p>

<p>
Since the day she had gone to Abercorn I had
seen little of her.  She was exhausted on her
return, and I had had to content myself with her
nod and some ambiguous words to the effect that all
was well 'so far.'  She made no further allusion to
her scheme, and I felt she avoided me.  This was
natural, for my lack of enthusiasm made me a bad
confidant in the matter of a forlorn hope.
Desperation needs no cold water.  For my part I was
glad to escape the thankless role of critic.
</p>

<p>
But now the hour had struck for her intervention.
</p>

<p>
'Oughtn't you to be in bed?' she asked Archie
as she joined us.
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders and told her that next
day he was going to Abercorn.
</p>

<p>
Norah took a deep quick breath like a man about
to dive.
</p>

<p>
'Archie,' she said, 'is it because of me?'
</p>

<p>
From his seat he looked up at her slim figure
whose intensity seemed to quiver like a spear struck
into the ground.  He was, I saw, reluctant to speak.
</p>

<p>
Ntula's chickens came to his rescue with a sudden
squawking and a beating of wings.  Archie signed
to Changalilo to untie their legs and to give the
basket of meal to the carriers to divide among them.
</p>

<p>
Norah stood motionless, her short hair flambant
in the slanting rays of the sun.  She repeated the
question that Archie had not answered.  He looked
round him as if seeking escape.
</p>

<p>
'Norah,' he said, 'what's the good of going into
all this?  It's done now.'
</p>

<p>
'Even so,' she said, her voice as calm as the
evening light, 'even if it is, is it fair to either of
us&mdash;to me,' she corrected, 'this silence?'
</p>

<p>
Archie reflected.  You could always lever up
Archie with the word 'unfair.'
</p>

<p>
I turned away with a feeling of intrusion.  Yet
Norah might need my support.  I watched in the
top branches of a tree a fishing eagle, sitting solid
in the yellow sunlight.  The big white bird with
its square black head looked as if it had been
chopped out of wood with rough, sure blows.
</p>

<p>
'No,' I heard Archie say almost casually, 'I do
not want to go on living without you.'
</p>

<p>
'Then live with me,' cried Norah.  The spear
seemed to crumple, to collapse, and turn to a girl
crouched on her knees at her husband's feet,
fumbling for his hand.
</p>

<p>
The fishing eagle flapped slowly and as if
contemptuously into the gathering darkness.
</p>

<p>
I could not hear all that Norah said.  Naturally
I did not try.  I wanted to leave them, but the
battle was joined, not won; at any moment I might
be called on.
</p>

<p>
From the scattered words that reached my ear,
I knew that she was telling him how the kiss in the
ruins was given and in what spirit it was accepted.
She told him how in the hills she had come to see
he cared, and how the knowledge had brought her
back to her place at his side.  If she could not give
him passion&mdash;passion was trodden out of her, she
said&mdash;she could give him affection, if he could accept
it....
</p>

<p>
It was dark now and some one in the village
behind us began listlessly to tap a drum.  It covered
Norah's voice.  While she fought for Archie's life,
did she hear, I wondered, another drum and see a
swinging light that had guided another man to her
and on, so quickly, to his death?
</p>

<p>
At last Archie spoke, and I heard his male tones
above the drum.
</p>

<p>
'You've taken away the bitterness,' he said, 'the
bitterness of believing ... that about you.  You
must forgive me for doubting....'
</p>

<p>
'And you have to forgive so much,' I heard her
break in.
</p>

<p>
They sat in silence; in the light of the fire I could
see his fingers tangling her tawny hair.  The drummer
had begun to play in earnest and the syncopated,
staccato throb seemed to force the wall of the forest
to yield a little to its urgency before closing behind
it, like a thick velvet curtain.  Archie spoke at last
and I saw Norah draw in her breath.  His words
came to me in fragments.
</p>

<p>
He was glad, so glad she had told him, but it
could not alter ... letter to Lavater somewhere
at the Boma ... found sooner or later
... intolerable to wait on its chance discovery
... must see Lavater himself to-morrow.
</p>

<p>
Norah's first weapon I saw had broken.  I had
never thought it a strong one.  She could give
Archie the comfort that she was not the trull he
had judged her, she could not give him hope that
she loved him.  She could suppress a reason for
not living, she could not make him want to live.
</p>

<p>
In the second round she held stronger cards.  I
saw her lips move, pleading with Archie's obstinacy.
I could not hear the words.  She was offering him
a paper.
</p>

<p>
'But that's the letter I wrote to Lavater,' he
cried.  She nodded, her eyes dancing in the firelight.
</p>

<p>
'How on earth did you get it?'
</p>

<p>
The drum ceased abruptly.  Silence swept up
like a wave.
</p>

<p>
'Stole it,' said Norah, and told him how.
</p>

<p>
She had reached, she said, the Boma before sunset.
Lavater, so Joseph told her, had been expected all
the afternoon.  If she cared to wait, he would be
sure to look in at the office on his way home.
</p>

<p>
As she sat there, her mind worked ceaselessly on
the cause she had come to fight, while her eyes darted
nervously about the room.  They were arrested by
a familiar writing on the table in front of her.
The blue envelope was addressed in Archie's hand....
It contained his confession.
</p>

<p>
Her brain leapt from perception to plan.  Joseph
she sent on an errand to the store.  The moment he
left the room, she seized a pen and scribbled a note
of thanks for the milk and vegetables.  This she
slipped into the envelope that had contained the
fatal letter.  With the office gum she re-fastened
the flap.
</p>

<p>
As she replaced it, Lavater's shadow crossed the
window.  She went to meet him with her heart
beating noisily, she thought, against the stolen
paper.  She had come, she said, to ask leave to
borrow some drugs from the Boma stores.  And
Lavater suspected nothing, but with expressions of
concern found her the medicines.
</p>

<p>
The end of her recital was drowned in a fresh
burst of drumming, but I was glad to see that
civilisation had not recaptured Archie completely.
Admiration for Norah's resource shone on his thin
face.  Admiration and gratitude.  Then the sadness
which had lifted returned.
</p>

<p>
'Norah,' he said, 'what a brick you are!  I think
it's the most sporting effort I've ever heard of.  No
one but you....  But you see, don't you?  I
can't profit by what you've done.'  He turned the
paper in his hands.  'I've got to go through with
it now.'  Norah, worsted in the second encounter,
rose to her feet and faced him.  Her lips framed the
word "Why?"
</p>

<p>
'Because I'm a murderer,' he said, looking over
her head, blindly, into the darkness.
</p>

<p>
As she did not speak, he went on carefully,
dispassionately.
</p>

<p>
At first, he said, he had justified himself.  In the
forest, he had seemed to stand outside the Law...
But Abercorn with its trim roads, its comfortable
houses, its kind, commonplace inhabitants had
drawn him back into its fold.  Obscurely he felt
that by accepting the standards of Jehovah and of
the forest, he was deserting from the forces that for
twenty or thirty centuries had fought for order, to
make things shipshape, sane, reasonable.
</p>

<p>
White men went native sometimes, abjured their
heritage, married black wives, lived in mud huts,
ate native food.  Well, if he set up in his heart the
values he had found in the forest, he'd be a renegade
like them.
</p>

<p>
Norah, who had bitten on her lip till it nearly
bled, broke in with a cry of indignation.
</p>

<p>
What had this, she asked, to do with Dick's
death?  Why should Archie sacrifice his own life for
vague ideas about Abercorn and society!  What had
society ever done for him?  Let society look after
itself!
</p>

<p>
'I'm not being clear,' said Archie; 'what I mean
is that until I saw Abercorn standing like an advance
guard in the fight for...'  He felt his words were
high-flown and he said, 'all that' with a dismissing
wave of the hand.  'I did not feel I had done
wrong.  Abercorn showed me that I had.  Now I
must pay for what I did.'
</p>

<p>
'But Archie, Archie!  What's the good?  Dick's
dead and nothing you can do will bring him to
life.'
</p>

<p>
He was silent.
</p>

<p>
'All you'll do will be to agonise your father, your
relations and friends.  And me.  <i>You'll</i> pay, you
say.  But what about us?'
</p>

<p>
His lips moved but I heard no word.
</p>

<p>
'If it did any good,' she went on, 'we'd&mdash;I'd be
glad, proud to suffer for you.  But all for nothing!
For an idea!'
</p>

<p>
Archie shrugged his shoulders.  'Don't some
people say ideas are everything?' he asked me.
</p>

<p>
They had begun to dance in the village.  Hand-clapping
strengthened the beat of the drum and the
shrill monotonous voices of women singing, as they
jogged to the rhythm.
</p>

<p>
'You were provoked, you were ill with fever,'
Norah began.
</p>

<p>
'I haven't told you all,' Archie interrupted.
'Have you thought what life now holds for me?'
</p>

<p>
Without expiation he could never again have
peace of mind.  He must be ready at any moment
to lie to his friends.  At any moment a sincere
word might be his ruin.  Never would he feel clean.
And as, to one of his nature, long duplicity was
intolerable, he would have to live alone to escape.
Alone, what memories would haunt him!  What
escape would there be from the vision of the
defenceless man he had murdered.
</p>

<p>
The dance had come to an end and the singing
ceased.  I looked at Norah feeling she was beaten
and was surprised to see her poise herself as if to
deliver a blow.
</p>

<p>
'Defenceless, Archie?  Murdered?  It was fair
fight.'
</p>

<p>
'Fair fight?' he echoed.
</p>

<p>
'Dick would have killed you if you hadn't killed
him!'
</p>

<p>
I shared Archie's astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'I didn't give him much chance then,' he said
grimly.
</p>

<p>
'But Dick fired first, he fired at you first!' cried
Norah.
</p>

<p>
Archie passed his hand over his eyes.
</p>

<p>
'It's all blurred like a bad dream,' he said, 'but
I fired before his rifle was up.'
</p>

<p>
Norah's reply was unexpected.  'Changalilo,' she
called.
</p>

<p>
Changalilo emerged from the kitchen.
</p>

<p>
'Changalilo, there are some cartridges missing.'  The
native was silent.
</p>

<p>
'How many cartridges were there for Bwana
Dick's gun?'
</p>

<p>
'Two, Mama.'
</p>

<p>
'There's only one now.'
</p>

<p>
With deference Changalilo reminded her that one
had been fired the night the Bwana had shot the
eland, the night that Bwana Dick-i...
</p>

<p>
'Are you sure one was fired then?' said Archie
slowly and as if he dreaded the answer.
</p>

<p>
Changalilo was emphatic, and added that he had
cleaned the fouled gun, when the Mama had brought
it back to camp.
</p>

<p>
Norah dismissed the native.  'Do you believe
me now?' she asked.  Archie sank back into his
chair with his head between his hands.
</p>

<p>
'I saw Dick,' she said, putting every ounce of her
will into her speech, 'pick up his rifle and fire at
you from his hip.  He missed you and you killed
him before he could fire the second shot.  Is that
murder?'
</p>

<p>
There was a long pause.  The drumming and
singing burst out again.  Men's voices singing, I
judged, a song of war.  They had thrown dried
grass on to their fire, lighting the underside of the
trees into pale silver.  The shadows of the invisible
dancers leapt and flapped like fantastic birds.
</p>

<p>
I caught a glimpse of Norah's triumphant eyes
before the grass was burnt and the light fell.  Lying
at Archie's feet, I saw a paper torn in four."

<h3>
EPILOGUE
</h3>

<p>
Ross smoked a time in silence.  At length he
spoke.  "Archie did not give in at once," he
said.  "His Scottish instincts put up a rearguard
action.  But Norah's account of Dick's death had
won the day.
</p>

<p>
He protested indeed, but without his old conviction,
that he must stand his trial and be formally
exonerated.  I dropped heavily on the suggestion.
What was he thinking of? I asked.  What was
the use of dragging Norah through the mud of the
courts, of giving to the press the story of her
elopement?  Was it fair to sacrifice her name on the
altar of his exoneration?
</p>

<p>
Archie collapsed; it was never hard to put him
in the wrong.  Soon I left for bed.  Husband and
wife sat on by the fire.  Bad perhaps for his fever
but to the good of his happiness.
</p>

<p>
It was long before I slept.  The duel I had
witnessed was fought again in my head.  At last
I fell asleep, still wondering if Norah had told an
inspired lie; if she had been rash enough to teach
Changalilo the tale he had repeated; or if Dick had
really fired before he died.
</p>

<p>
It was Changalilo who enlightened me.
</p>

<p>
Next day Norah went up to the Boma to report
Ward's disappearance.  She would not, I suppose,
trust Archie in Abercorn.  She gave me instructions
to see to his soup in the middle of the morning.
About eleven I went to the kitchen to find out if it
was ready.  I found Changalilo and the sukambali
squatting on the ground, stirring a saucepan, with
their backs towards me.  I was wearing tennis shoes
and my approach was unheard.
</p>

<p>
'Did the Mama think I had stolen the cartridge?'
Changalilo was saying; 'I do not know.'
</p>

<p>
He went back to relate the original discovery of
the two rounds that fitted Dick's 7.9 Mauser, and
how they had lain in its magazine till the day of the
eland.
</p>

<p>
'I was making the chief's dinner,' said Changalilo,
'on the fire.  I heard from the hills not far off,
first the boom'&mdash;he imitated the sound&mdash;'of Bwana
Ar-i-shy's gun for elephant.  Then not a moment
later the crack'&mdash;again an imitation&mdash;'of the little
gun.'
</p>

<p>
Soon after the Mama brought him the little gun
with only one cartridge in the magazine and he had
cleaned the barrel.  Now she had forgotten that she
had fired at the eland and missed.  So he was
blamed.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, indeed,' said the sukambali, 'the chief
forgets and the slave is beaten.'
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'First the boom of the elephant gun; then the
crack of Dick's gun.'  I could guess what had
happened.
</p>

<p>
Archie had shot Dick through the heart.  As he
fell, his contracting fingers closed on the trigger of
his 7.9 and the bullet went into the air, into the
ground.  Archie, deafened by the explosion from
his heavy weapon and dizzy with fever, had not
heard that posthumous, as one might call it, shot.
When Norah had first told me her story, she
related how she had picked up Dick's rifle and
automatically had opened the breech.  Some fresh point
had crossed her brain, and she had not told me she
had noticed the empty cartridge case.  Memory of
that detail had burst on her when she retold the
story, and saw how it could be manipulated by a
wife who was brave enough to shoulder the weight
of her husband's crime."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Ross stopped speaking.
</p>

<p>
After a long silence broken only by the throbbing
of the engines, "Is that the end?" I asked.
</p>

<p>
"The worst of you writers," said Ross, "is that
you expect a story to have a beginning and an end.
Life isn't so tidy.  Death itself doesn't end the
story, except possibly for the dead man....
</p>

<p>
Who is the platitude-monger who talks about the
ever-widening circle of ripples started by any stone
you care to fling into the duck-pond of life?  Well,
the wash started by that ill-timed kiss of Dick's came
near, as I have shown you, to swamping the
Sinclairs' boat.  It may still swamp it."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I saw them off," he continued, "on their slow
ulendo to the coast, within a week of that
momentous conversation, myself taking in hand the sale
of the cattle, the disposal of the farm, the
disinterment of the ivory.
</p>

<p>
But now that they are back in England, do you
fancy they have forgotten?  Forgetting is not as
easy as you happy-ending merchants make out.
And the Sinclairs have plenty to forget....
</p>

<p>
Don't you think that sometimes, in some chance
combination of words, Norah hears Dick Ward
speak...?  Suppose she comes across his friends,
his relations....  Sometimes, on nights when she
cannot sleep, will not the burden of the guilt she
shouldered seem too heavy...?
</p>

<p>
Archie too.  Don't you think he ever sees a face,
a face that is partly eaten away by a hyæna, a
face on which he is raking the wet earth?  When
Norah whistles&mdash;it is a habit of hers&mdash;doesn't he
see her saunter into that sunlit clearing and watch
the light die in her eyes as she recognises him?"
</p>

<p>
Ross began ponderously to pace the deck, his
bulk visible against the eastern sky.  I fell into
step beside him.
</p>

<p>
"The Come-back of the Erring Wife isn't as
simple as it looks at the end of Reel Five," he said.
"Those silver-haired husbands with wistful faces,
whose lines are caressed by the glow of the dying
fire, as they lay a hand of forgiveness on the girl
wife's golden head, they aren't found in every home.
</p>

<p>
Still Norah stood a fair chance with Archie.  He
always thought for himself and never accepted as
gold the counters that pass for ideas.  He would
grant, I fancy, that courage may be as valuable a
feature in a wife as chastity."
</p>

<p>
"Who was it said that purity is the bull point of
the plain woman?" Ross asked me.
</p>

<p>
I did not reply.  It sounded to me much like Ross.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's something in it," he resumed.
"Why do men love the memories of the fair and
frail and forget good wives and mothers?  Why will
Queen Cleopatra's fame increase when Queen Victoria
is forgotten?"  He paused and seemed to
expect an answer.  I said something about
Shakespeare.
</p>

<p>
"Rubbish," he replied, "how many people have
read that play?  But you're taking me off my point.
Men marry widows and, as far as Dick was concerned,
Norah might nearly rank as a widow.  They
say that patriotism died with the war and virginity
with the higher education of women.  Well, if it did,
Archie would be one of those who would make the
best of a bad job.  I don't mean that he'd sit by,
while his wife climbed in and out of other men's
beds like the heroines of Mr. Arlen's novels.  On
the contrary, you've seen he had a pretty short way
with the other man.  But he never subscribed to
the view of the Church of Paul that sex was the only
thing that mattered.  And in his darkest hour, he
had never been able to conquer his love for Norah."
</p>

<p>
I suggested that her indifference would in the end
effect that conquest.
</p>

<p>
"Indifference?" said Ross quickly.  "To run off
with a man, when you think your husband ignores
you, is not indifference.  Any more than it is
indifference to load his crime on your guilty
shoulders."
</p>

<p>
"In any case," I protested, "she told you she
didn't love him."
</p>

<p>
"For the time, the tragedy she had brought about
had trodden out of her that blend of illusion and
realism we call 'love,' leaving her potent for no
impulse more romantic than devotion.  When she
reached home and the horror had receded, her
quick-blooded nature would need to twine round
some man's heart.  She would think more than
twice before she looked beyond her husband a
second time.  And now she knows his strength no
less than his weakness.  Not a bad basis for love."
</p>

<p>
The flippancy which Ross affected was momentarily
laid aside.  "I believe," he said slowly, "I
pray, that by now Norah and Archie Sinclair's
hearts are so locked together by sympathy,
understanding and affection that they can face together
the black hours they cannot hope to escape."
</p>

<p>
"In any case," I said, "he cannot judge her."
</p>

<p>
"Because he'd killed Dick?"
</p>

<p>
I nodded.
</p>

<p>
"So you agree with Archie, that was wrong?"
</p>

<p>
"Don't you?" I asked.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
I shivered in the chill that comes before the dawn.
Land was visible on the port and I guessed we were
rounding Gardafui.  Before us lay Europe, behind
us Africa.
</p>

<p>
Life was stirring on the liner.  Clattering his pail,
a sailor started to swab the deck.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
